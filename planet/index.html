Individually, they are each sensible and justified but taken as a whole they make me a little nervous about investing heavily in Unity. It’s a shame, because I would love to use the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone">Ubuntu phone</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell">Gnome Shell</a> is largely written in js and is on its way to building a <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">healthy ecosystem of extensions</a> (or will be, if it stops breaking them every version bump). It even has an <a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/LookingGlass">almost-functional repl</a> which surely can be shoe-horned into running <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">cljs</a>. It’s missing the HUD but most of the applications I use have their own CLI anyway. As proof of its flexibility, it has acquired not one but three tiling window managers: <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/657/shelltile/">shelltile</a>, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/294/shellshape/">shellshape</a> and <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/">gtile</a>. Of course, all them were broken by the 3.8 update…</p> <p><a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> has <a href="http://www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmadesktop/">plasma</a>, which it uses for … uh … desktop widgets. It also has <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities">activities</a> which are almost a fantastic idea but it uses them to manage … desktop widgets. I don’t remember the last time I saw my desktop. If I’m being unfair to KDE it stems from frustration – they were way ahead of the game on customisation and inter-application communication and they don’t seem to have done anything <em>useful</em> with it.</p> <p>There are also a million minimalist desktop environments but I prefer to have most of my work done for me, so long as I have the power to monkey-patch anything I disagree with. Vertical integration can be a beautiful thing when it works.</p> <p>So it looks like Gnome Shell wins. People complain that it is unusable without extensions. For my purposes that is irrelevant. Most of my favourite software is unusable without customisation (especially emacs). What is important is the potential for sculpting it into something better.</p> <h1>Experience</h1> <p>The <a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool">Gnome Tweak Tool</a> is absolutely essential. I have a few other extensions installed so far but none are particularly essential. There are a few more I will have to write myself.</p> <p>I expected to find <a href="http://cooperteam.net/">Gnome Do</a> indispensable. I can’t quite puy my finger on the reason but I instead found it intensely annoying and quickly uninstalled it. I think it’s an uncanny valley thing – it’s <em>almost</em> a real repl. Adding panels to the <a href="http://media.bestofmicro.com/fedora-linux-gnome,M-M-329998-13.png">Overview</a> might be a better option for me.</p> <p>Most of my setup time was burned on remapping keys. Gnome doesn’t run .xprofile or .Xmodmaprc and adding them to gnome-session doesn’t persist the changes across suspend/hibernate. I spent a while trying to remap keys <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Map_scancodes_to_keycodes">at the kernel level</a> before eventually realising that Gnome Tweak Tool has a keyboard section. It doesn’t have all the options I want but it does mean I can crib from their remapping code later.</p> <p>Similarly, Gnome overrides the xorg.conf touchpad settings and its settings dialog doesn’t provide an vertical-edge-scroll option. Fortunately the setting still exists and can be set with dconf-editor under <code>org/gnome/settings-daemon/touchpad</code>. Again, I’m leaning towards configuring this in js in the future to keep all my changes in the same place.</p> <p>So far I’m impressed at the potential of Gnome Shell, if not the default reality. The overview completion is fast and accurate. The notification system is a big improvement over Gnome 2 (especially the on/off toggle). The animations are smooth even on my integrated graphics. The ui and icons are simple and clear. With the dark theme enabled the shell is beautiful without getting in the way. Beauty is important in anything I spend half my life staring at.</p> <h1>Bonus</h1> <p>I also took the oppurtunuity to switch from <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> to <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>. Partly because of the nervousness I mentioned earlier, but also because Ubuntu keeps fucking overwriting my config files. I’ve given up touching anything beneath the surface because every Ubuntu upgrade breaks everything. Arch seems to be more kindly inclined towards tinkering and customisation and the wiki is a fantastic resource for learning about linux internals. It has a reputation for being unstable but since my new job will be developing in Windows on a fancy desktop the risk of breakage on my laptop isn’t a big deal. And it doesn’t overwrite my config files without asking.</p> <p>The installation was straight-forward apart from a <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162725">known mistake</a> in this months iso. My hardware all worked without any configuration. Suspend and hibernate are faster and more reliable than they were in Ubuntu. My battery life is slightly better. <a href="http://kmkeen.com/pacmatic/">Pacmatic</a> somewhat alleviates the fear of breakage. Installing proprietary software (skype, spotify) has not been a problem. I did have to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration#Infinality:_the_easy_way">tweak the fonts</a> and I have still have some missing unicode characters in firefox which I haven’t yet looked into.</p> <h1>Next</h1> <p>The next part of this series (which is due at some undetermined point in the future) will probably be writing a hello-world style extension in <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">cljs</a> as the first step towards a document-centric tiling window manager.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post2','post1')" class="btn" href="#0d10490c0c43827e5992c247475da3bf">Hide</a></div></span>

Back to the drawing board…</p> <p>I use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/opml-support/">OPML Support</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/brief/">Brief</a> to replace google reader and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/">Evolution</a> to back up google mail, calendar and contacts. My address is on my own domain and managed by google apps. I don’t yet use a local mail reader but Evolution looks like a reasonable fallback if I have to drop gmail.</p> <p>For music I use <a href="http://www.tomahawk-player.org/">Tomahawk</a> with a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify Premium</a> account as the main resolver. I create playlists in Tomahawk using both the chart apis and the <a href="http://echonest.com/">Echo Nest</a> api and sync them to Spotify to download to my phone. There’s still a little too much manual button pressing in that process but it’s much easier than managing my own collection. Both Tomahawk and Spotify mobile scrobble to my last.fm account which I backup with <a href="https://gitorious.org/fmthings/lasttolibre/blobs/master/lastexport.py">lastexport</a>.</p> <p>Facebook is really the only service I couldn’t replace, due to a combination of network effects and poor export tools. I use the builtin export service but unfortunately it seems to be pretty hard to automate. The only non-proprietary solution I could find was <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/archivefacebook/">ArchiveFacebook</a> which I suppose could be run from the command line somehow. For now I just set a monthly reminder in my calendar.</p> <p>So now I have all my cloud data synced on my machine where the backup tools from my last post can take care of it.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post4','post3')" class="btn" href="#b1916c31531bff1154076da22bc85c50">Hide</a></div></span>

Esther Baruk gave a high-level description of Lexifi's activity (besides "paying Alain Frisch to do cool things"). It was a balance of the abstract idea of bringing the elegance of formalism (the very kind that abounds in functional programming) to financial contracts, and practical use of a programming language (a dialect of OCaml) as a <em>product</em> to sell to finance companies.</p> <p>Benoît Vaugon talked about the OCaml bytecode, not only as a backend for the OCaml compiler, but as an input format for various OCaml-related tools: dead code elimination, his embedded PIC runtime, and finally his <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-bytes/ocamlcc">OCamlCC</a> project, compiling bytecode programs to native C code. It was extremely interesting, but probably more technical than the audience expected. It is difficult not to be a bit overwhelmed when you are presented a subtle program analyzer, an implementation of the whole OCaml runtime in 8-bit assembly, and an optimizing compiler to C all at the same time.</p> <p>Finally, Frédéric Bour talked about <a href="https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin">Merlin</a>, a project that provides semantics-aware editor modes for OCaml for both Vim and Emacs, and promises to scale neatly to even more cool features and other editors. I suspect the presentation itself was a bit rough, but the software demo was definitely impressive enough. I discussed a bit Merlin's happy design choices <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-02/msg00155.html">in the caml-list announce thread</a>.</p> <p>We then had some time for informal discussion (and pizzas), and I enjoyed seeing a lot of different people I sometimes hadn't heard about in a while.</p> <h3 id="technical-notes">Technical notes</h3> <p>The sources of the slides are actually <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/ocaml-paris-meeting-may-2013-scherer.text">a Markdown file</a> and the compilation process is extremely simple, using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> with the compilation options detailed at the end of the slides sources -- an idea I stole from Nicolas Pouillard. I wouldn't use that for a technical presentation with maths, but it was useful to be in a browser to easily follow links.</p> <p>I think it would be nice to have a webpage to aggregate the slides of all presenters. I opened <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/148">a suggestion</a> on the ocaml.org issue tracker, but didn't get an answer so far.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#cdbfb73e84dde1fa1aaa126158d68dbb">Hide</a></div></span>

I spend a lot of time hacking the OCaml compiler. Hence when I write some code, I have a good glimpse of what the generated assembly will look like.

A small voice in my head is telling me "you shouldn't write it like that, you known you could avoid this allocation". And usually, following that indication would only tend to make the code less readable. But there is a solution to calm that voice: making the compiler smarter than me.</p><p>OCaml compilation mechanisms are quite predictable. There is no dark magic to replace your ugly code by a well-behaving one, but it always generates reasonably efficient code. This is a good thing in general, as you won't be surprised by code running more slowly than what you usually expect. But it does not behave very well with dumb code. This may not often seem like a problem with code written by humans, but generated code, for example coming from camlp4/ppx, or compiled from another language to OCaml, may fall into that category. In fact, there is another common source for non-human written code: inlining.</p><h2> Inlining</h2><p>Inlining (or inline expansion) is a key optimisation in many compilers and particularly in functional languages. Inlining replaces a function call by the function body. Let's apply inlining to f in this example.</p><pre><code>let f x = x + 1 let g y = f (f y) </code></pre><p>We replace the calls to f by let for each arguments and then copy the body of f.</p><pre><code>let g y = let x1 = y in let r1 = x1 + 1 in let x2 = r1 in let r2 = x2 + 1 in r2 </code></pre><p>Inlining allows to eliminate the cost of a call (and associated spilling), but the main point is elsewhere: it puts the code in its context, allowing its specialisation. When you look at that generated code after inlining your trained eyes will notice that it looks quite dumb. And you really want to rewrite it as:</p><pre><code>let g y = y + 2 </code></pre><p>The problem is that OCaml is compiling smart code into smart assembly, but after inlining your code is not as smart as it used to be. What is missing in the current compiler is a way to get back a nice and smart code after inlining. (To be honest, OCaml is not that bad and on that example it would generate the right code: put this on the sake of the mandatory blog-post dramatic effect.)</p><p>In fact you could consider inlining as two separate things: duplication and call elimination. By duplication you make a new version of the function that is specialisable in its context, and by call elimination you replace the call by specialised code. This distinction is important because there are some cases where you only want to do duplication: recursive functions.</p><h3> Recursive function inlining</h3><p>In a recursive function duplicating and removing a call is similar to loop unrolling. This can be effective in some cases, but this is not what we want to do in general. Lets try it on <code>List.map</code></p><pre><code>let rec list_map f l = match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; f a :: list_map f r let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in list_map succ l </code></pre><p>If we simply inline the body of list_map we obtain this</p><pre><code>let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; succ a :: list_map succ r </code></pre><p>And with some more inlining we get this which is probably not any faster than the original code.</p><pre><code>let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; a + 1 :: list_map succ r </code></pre><p>Instead we want the function to be duplicated.</p><pre><code>let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in let rec list_map' f l = match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; f a :: list_map' f r in list_map' succ l </code></pre><p>Now we know that <code>list_map'</code> will never escape its context hence that its f parameter will always be succ. Hence we can replace <code>f</code> by succ everywhere in its body.</p><pre><code>let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in let rec list_map' f l = match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; succ a :: list_map' succ r in list_map' succ l </code></pre><p>And we can now see that the <code>f</code> parameter is not used anymore, we can eliminate it.</p><pre><code>let l' = let succ = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in let rec list_map' l = match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; succ a :: list_map' r in list_map' l </code></pre><p>With some more inlining and cleaning we finally obtain this nicely specialised function which will be faster than the original.</p><pre><code>let l' = let rec list_map' l = match l with | [] -&gt; [] | a::r -&gt; a + 1 :: list_map' r in list_map' l </code></pre><h3> Current state of the OCaml inliner</h3><p>Inlining can gain a lot, but abusing it will increase code size a lot. This is not only a problem of binary size (who cares?): if your code does not fit in processor cache anymore, its speed will be limited by memory bandwidth.</p><p>To avoid that, OCaml has a threshold to the function size allowed for inlining. The compiler may also refuse to inline in other cases that are not completely justified though, mainly for reasons related to its architecture:</p><ul> <li> <p>duplication and call elimination are not separated, hence recursive function duplication is not possible.</p> </li><li> <p>functions containing structured constants or local functions are not allowed to be duplicated, preventing those functions to be inlined.</p> </li> </ul><pre><code>let constant x = let l = [1] in x::l let local_function x = let g x = some closed function in ... g x ... </code></pre><p>The assumption is that if a function contains a constant or a function it will be too big to be reasonably inlined. But there is a reasonable transformation that could allow it.</p><pre><code>let l = [1] let constant x = x::l let g x = some closed function let local_function x = ... g x ... </code></pre><p>and then we can reasonably inline <code>constant</code> and <code>local_function</code>. Those cases are only technical limitation that could easily be lifted with the new implementation.</p><p>But improving the OCaml inliner is not that easy. It is well written, but it is also doing a lot of other things at the same time:</p><h4> closure conversion</h4><p>closure conversion transforms functions to a data structure containing a code pointer and the free variables of the function. You could imagine it as that transformation:</p><pre><code>let a = 1 let f x = x + a (* a is a free variable in f *) let r = f 42 </code></pre><p>Here <code>a</code> is a free variable of <code>f</code>. We cannot compile <code>f</code> while it contains reference to free variables. To get rid of the free variables, we add a new parameter to the function, the environment, containing all the free variables.</p><pre><code>let a = 1 let f x environment = (* the new environment parameter contains all the free variables of f *) x + environment.a let f_closure = { code = f; environment = { a = a } } let r = f_closure.code 42 f_closure.environment </code></pre><h4> Value analysis</h4><p>In functional languages inlining is not as simple as it is for languages like C because the function name does not tells you which function is used at a call site:</p><pre><code>let f x = (x,(fun y -&gt; y+1)) let g x = let (a,h) = f x in h a </code></pre><p>To be able to inline h as (fun y -&gt; y+1) the compiler needs to track which values flows to variables. This is usually called a value analysis. This example can look a bit contrived, but in practice functor application generate quite similar code. This allows for instance to inline Set.Make(...).is_empty. The result of this value analysis is used by other optimisations:</p><h4> Constant folding</h4><p>When the value analysis can determine that the result of an operation is a constant, it can remove its computation:</p><pre><code>let f x = let a = 1 in let b = a + 1 in x + b </code></pre><p>Since <code>b</code> always have the value <code>2</code> and <code>a + 1</code> does not have side effects it is possible to simplify it.</p><pre><code>let f x = x + 2 </code></pre><h4> Direct call specialisation</h4><p>Sometimes it is impossible to know which function will be used at a call site:</p><pre><code>let f g x = g x </code></pre><p>There is a common representation (the closure) that allows to call a function without knowing anything about it. Using a function through its closure is called a generic call. This is efficient, but of course not as efficient as a simple assembly call (a direct call). The work of the direct call specialisation is to turn as many as possible generic call into direct ones. In practice, the vast majority of calls can be optimised.</p><h2> Improving OCaml inliner</h2><p>The current architecture is very fast and works well on a lot of cases, but it is quite difficult to improve the handling of corner cases.</p><p>I have started a complete rewrite of those passes, I am currently working on splitting all those things in their own passes. The first step was to add a new intermediate representation (flambda) more suited to doing the various analysis. The main difference with the current representation (clambda) is that closures are explicitly represented, making them easier to manipulate. As a nice side effect this intermediate representation allows to plug passes in or out, or loop on them without changing anything to the architecture. But we are losing the possibility to enforce some invariants in the type of the representation, hence we need to be careful to correctly maintain them.</p><p>With this new architecture, the closure conversion is done first (going from lambda to flambda). Then on flambda are provided a set of simple analysis:</p><ul> <li> <p>simple intraprocedural value and alias analysis</p> </li><li> <p>purity analysis</p> </li><li> <p>constant analysis</p> </li><li> <p>dead expression analysis</p> </li> </ul><p>And there is a set of simple passes using their results:</p><ul> <li> <p>dead code elimination</p> </li><li> <p>constant folding/direct call specialisation/type specialisation: a simple traversal replacing expressions with more efficient ones when the result of the value analysis allows it.</p> </li><li> <p>alias rebinding: Use results of alias analysis to know when a field access can be simplified:</p> </li> </ul><pre><code>let f x = let tuple = (x,x) in let (y,z) = tuple in y + z let f x = x + x </code></pre><p>Of course nobody would write that, but access to variables bounded in a closure can looks a lot like that after inlining:</p><pre><code>let f x = let g y = x + y in g x </code></pre><p>After closure conversion we obtain this.</p><pre><code>let f x = let g_closure = { code = fun x environment -&gt; environment.x + y; environment = { x = x } } in g_closure.code x g_closure.environment </code></pre><p>And after inlining <code>g</code>.</p><pre><code>let f x = let g_closure = { code = fun x environment -&gt; environment.x + y; environment = { x = x } } in x + closure.environment.x </code></pre><p>Inlining <code>g</code> makes some code that looks a bit stupid. <code>closure.environment.x</code> is always the same value as <code>x</code>. So there is no need to access it through the structure.</p><pre><code>let f x = let g_closure = { code = fun x environment -&gt; environment.x + y; environment = { x = x } } in x + x </code></pre><p>Now that we have simplified the code, we notice that g_closure is not used anymore, and dead code elimination can simply get rid of it.</p><pre><code>let f x = x + x </code></pre><ul> <li> <p>a really, really dumb inliner: it inlines almost anything. Its interest is to demonstrate what can be achieved when putting some code in its context.</p> </li> </ul><p>After the different optimisation passes we need to send the result to the compiler back-end. This is done by the final conversion from flambda to clambda, which is mainly doing a lot of bureaucratic transformations and mark constant structured values. Doing this constant marking separately also allows to improve a bit the generated code.</p><pre><code>let rec f x = let g y = f y in g x </code></pre><p><code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are closed functions but the current compiler will not be able to detect it and allocate a closure for g at each call of f.</p><h2> Hey ! Where are the nice charts ?</h2><p>As you noticed that there were no fancy improvements charts, and there won't be any below. Those are demonstrations passes, the generated code can (and probably will) be worse than the one generated by the current compiler. This is mainly done to show what can be achieved by combining simple passes and simple analysis and allowing to apply them multiple times. What is needed to get fast code is to change the inlining heuristic (and re-enable cross module inlining).</p><p>My current work is to write more serious analysis allowing better optimisations. In particular I expect that a reasonable interprocedural value analysis could help a lot with handling recursive function specialisation.</p><h2> My future toys</h2><p>Then I'd like to play a bit with other common things like</p><ul> <li> <p>unused parameters elimination: when a function does not use one of its parameters, remove it. This is trivial with simple functions, but it can get a bit tricky with multiply recursive functions. (that kind of code can appear after constant folding with informations from interprocedural analysis )</p> </li><li> <p>lambda lifting: turning closure into closed function by adding arguments. This can eliminate some allocations</p> </li> </ul><pre><code>let f x = let g y = x + y in g 4 </code></pre><p>If we add the <code>x</code> parameter to <code>g</code> we can avoid building its closure each time <code>f</code> is called.</p><pre><code>let f x = let g y x = x + y in g 4 x </code></pre><p>This can get quite tricky if we want to handle cases like</p><pre><code>let f x n = let g i = i + x in Array.init n g </code></pre><p>We need to add a new parameter to init also to be able to pass it to g.</p><ul> <li> <p>common sub-expression elimination:</p> </li> </ul><pre><code>let f x = let a = x + 1 in let b = x + 1 in a + b </code></pre><p>In <code>f</code> We clearly don't need to compute <code>x + 1</code> two times</p><pre><code>let f x = let a = x + 1 in a + a </code></pre><ul> <li> <p>earlier unboxing: Floats are boxed in ocaml, this means that there is an indirection when accessing the constant of a value of type float. To reduce the cost of allocating and accessing floats unboxing eliminates the indirections between some operations. I'd like to try to do this as a flambda pass to be able to use the results of the value analysis.</p> </li> </ul><p>If you want to play/hack a bit with the demo look at my <a href="https://github.com/chambart/ocaml/tree/flambda_experiments">github branch</a> (be warned, this branch may sometimes be rebased)</p><a onclick="switchContent('post8','post7')" class="btn" href="#49cce4c805c48bcf79a463c3fa2abe47">Hide</a></div></span>

This gives Mirage a big boost, as we can re-use several of the documentation, build and test improvements in our own releases. You can read up on the group's activities via the <a href="http://ocaml.io/news">monthly updates</a>, or browse through the various <a href="http://ocaml.io/tasks">projects</a>. One of the more important projects is the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/tasks/platform.html#OCamlot">OCamlot</a> continuous build infrastructure, which will also be testing Mirage kernels as one of the supported backends.</p> </li><li> <p>As we head into release mode, we've started <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/tag/overview/meetings">weekly meetings</a> to coordinate all the activities. We're keeping notes as we go along, so you should be able to skim the notes and <a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-mirage/">mailing list archives</a> to get a feel for the overall activities. Anil is maintaining a <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/dev-preview-checklist">release checklist</a> for the summer developer preview.</p> </li><li> <p>Anil (along with Yaron Minsky and Jason Hickey) is finishing up an O'Reilly book on <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a>, which will be a useful guide to using OCaml for systems and network programming. If you'd like to review an early copy, please get in touch. The final book is anticipated to be released towards the end of the year, with a <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/category/roughcuts.do">Rough Cut</a> at the end of the summer.</p> </li><li> <p>The core system was described in an <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">ASPLOS 2013</a> paper, which should help you understand the background behind library operating systems. Some of the Mirage libraries are also currently being integrated into the next-generation <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2012/05/17/introducing-windsor-a-new-xen-based-virtualization-architecture/">Windsor</a> release of the Xen Cloud Platform, which means that several of the libraries will be used in production and hence move beyond research-quality code.</p> </li> </ul><p></p><p>In the next few months, the installation notes and getting started guides will all be revamped to match the reality of the new tooling, so expect some flux there. If you want to take an early try of Mirage beforehand, don't forget to hop on the <code>#mirage</code> IRC channel on Freenode and ping us with questions directly. We will also be migrating some of the project infrastructure to be fully self-hosted on Mirage and Xen, and placing some of the services onto the new <a href="http://xenproject.org">xenproject.org</a> infrastructure.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post10','post9')" class="btn" href="#6c19ae2bc30d389ea47380bb420105f2">Hide</a></div></span>
