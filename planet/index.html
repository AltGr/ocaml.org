<p>It's taken a good long while, but Real World OCaml is finally done.
You can read it for free at
<a href="http://realworldocaml.org">http://realworldocaml.org</a>, or buy a
<a href="http://amzn.to/1afkSIe">hardcopy</a> or an
<a href="http://amzn.to/1gzzxTO">ebook</a> <a href="http://oreil.ly/S2Vtdh">version</a>.</p>

<p>The idea for the book was born in a bar in Tokyo in 2011.  After
talk-filled day at ICFP, a few of us, Ashish Agarwal and Marius
Eriksen, Anil, and myself, went out drinking.  We were all bellyaching
over the lack of a high-quality OCaml book in English, and, emboldened
by the Guinness and egged on by Ashish and Marius, Anil and I decided
that we were just going to have to go ahead and write the book
ourselves.  We brought Jason into the project soon after.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, Anil and I had different visions for the
book.  From my perspective, it was a simple proposition: there was no
good book available, and we were going to write one.  The goal was to
document the state of the art so as to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>Anil's vision was grander.  He argued that writing a book is an
opportunity to discover all of the things that are just too
embarrassing to explain.  And, once discovered, you needed to find a
way to get all of those things fixed before the book was published.</p>

opportunity to discover all of the things that are just too
embarrassing to explain.  And, once discovered, you needed to find a
way to get all of those things fixed before the book was published.</p>

<p>It was Anil's grander vision that we followed, and to good effect.
It's not that we fixed the problems ourselves.  We solved some
problems directly, but by and large, we ended up getting help from
those who were better positioned than us to fix the problems at hand.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of pieces that came together over those two
years.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>OPAM.</em> The core work on OPAM was done by Thomas Gazagnaire at
OCamlPro (funded by Jane Street), with Anil collaborating closely.
This is probably the biggest improvement of the bunch.  It's hard to
overstate how transformational OPAM is.  Before OPAM, installing
OCaml libraries was a complex chore.  Now it's a joy.</li>
<li><em>The Core release process.</em> We decided early on to base the book on
Core, Jane Street's alternative to OCaml's standard library.  But
the release process around Core was too monolithic and too hard for
external collaborators.  We reorganized the process completely,
moving to weekly releases to github, with the repos broken out into
manageable components.  Most of this work was done by Jeremie Dimino
and Yury Sulsky at Jane Street.</li>
<li><em>Ctypes.</em> Anil was in charge of writing the section on C bindings,
and he decided that the standard way was just too painful to
explain.  That was the germ of ctypes, a library, written by Jeremy
Yallop, that lets you build C bindings entirely from within OCaml,
with a easy and simple interface.</li>
<li><em>Short paths.</em> One of the real pains associated with working with
Core is the heavy use that Core makes of the module system.  OCaml's
error messages, unfortunately, do not cope with this terribly well,
leading to absurd types in error messages, so you might see a type
rendered as <code>Core.Std.Int.Map.Key.t Core.Std.Option.Monad_infix</code>
where it could just as well have been rendered as <code>int option</code>.  We
worked with Jacques Garrigue to implement a better heuristic for
picking type names (suggested by Stephen Weeks, who implemented the
same heuristic for Mlton).  This is now available in the 4.01
version of the compiler, via the <code>-short-paths</code> patch.</li>
</ul>

<p>This period also saw the founding of OCaml Labs, a lab at Cambridge
University devoted to improving OCaml as a platform, with Anil at the
head.</p>

<p>And we're not done.  OCaml Labs and OCamlPro are still working on
improving OPAM and building out a curated OCaml Platform that's built
on top of OPAM.  There's ongoing work on improving documentation
generation so we can have better online API docs.  Jacques Garrigue
and Leo White are working on adding module aliases to OCaml which will
greatly improve compilation time for libraries like Core that need to
manage large namespaces.</p>

<p>And there are more projects that are improving OCaml and its
surrounding infrastructure that have no direct connection to Real
World OCaml, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frederic Bour and Thomas Refis' work on Merlin, a tool for providing
IDE-like tooling from within editors like VI and Emacs.</li>
<li>Mark Shinwell's work on improving GDB support for OCaml,</li>
<li>Fabrice le Fessant's work improving OCaml's interactions with
performance tools like perf. </li>
<li>Work that Ashish Agarwal, Christophe Troestler, Esther Baruk, and
now many others, have poured into improving the
<a href="http://ocaml.org">http://ocaml.org</a> website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Real World OCaml is of course a personal milestone for Jason, Anil and
myself (and for Leo White, Jeremy Yallop and Stephen Weeks, who made
some key contributions to the text).  But viewed from a broader
perspective, it's just one part of the increasing swirl of activity in
the OCaml community.</p>

<p>OCaml has been a great language for a very long time.  Now, we're
growing a social and technological infrastructure around it to match.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post2','post1')" class="btn" href="#6669830c2e0c05e85b490aca7e1d38e0">Hide</a></div></span>

Distributing binary packages with everything already compiled is pretty useful when you want to make sure that everyone has the same version of packages installed and you don't want to spend time configuring all the computer of your colleague.</p>


<p>As a matter of fact I was also interested to see that happening. I have several computers where I want to install a set of packages and I want to snapshot OPAM archives when I am ready for an upgrade. I have tested for a long time another source distribution: <a href="http://godi.camlcity.org">GODI</a>. I even wrote a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SylvainLeGall/posts/ahELQPy98Zb">puppet module</a> to drive it.

Especially even if it is fully automated, you get a lot of errors and timeout when trying to build automatically from source.</p>


<p>This is how <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/opam2debian">opam2debian</a> has started. I wanted a replacement for puppet-godi that takes advantage of OPAM and the possibility to distribute my set of packages everywhere quickly.</p>

<p>The goals of this project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>generate a Debian binary package with all the dependencies set on external packages (like libpcre)</li>
<li>use OPAM to build everything</li>
<li>use standard Debian process to build package</li>
<li>create snapshot of OPAM repository that allow to rebuild exactly the same thing on different arches</li>
</ol>

<p>The real challenge behind opam2debian was to be able to use standard Debian process to create package to get all the power of dependencies computation provided by the Debian maintainer scripts. My great achievement on this topic was to find a tool called <a href="http://proot.me/">proot</a> that allows you to bind mount a directory as a user. This is an achievement because it allows to create a package using a directory where you are not allowed to write (i.e. <em>/opt/opam2debian</em> directory which is owned by root). This is a way to do it on any Jenkins builder without root access and a standard way for Debian to build packages.</p>

<p>I need to compile a set of package to install on all my Jenkins builder. Here is the list of packages I need and I also want to use the latest OCaml version. I want to build a Debian package for Debian Wheezy which has only OCaml 3.12.1.</p>


<p>Building the package:</p>

<pre>$ opam2debian create --build --name opam2debian-test2 --compiler 4.01.0 \
 ocamlfind fileutils ocaml-data-notation ocaml-expect ounit \
 ocamlmod ocamlify oasis yojson sexplib extlib pcre-ocaml \
 calendar ocaml-inifiles ocamlnet ocurl gettext inotify ocaml-sqlexpr \
 ocamlrss ocaml-xdg-basedir</pre>


<p>Getting the package list right can be tricky because the process will stop at the first error -- and if it is because the last package fails to build it can be long. I have implemented a --keep-build-dir in case you want to tune the package list live.</p>


<p>The program will build everything and it can takes quite a while. At the end you get a file <em>opam2debian-test2_20131105_amd64.deb</em> which has a reasonable size of 232MB. That is big, but it looks like the biggest directory is <em>$OPAMROOT/4.01.0/build</em>, I am not sure if I can remove it but we may save some space here (the build directory represents 50% of the package size).</p>


<p>Then you can just do a standard Debian installation:</p>


<pre>$ sudo dpkg -i opam2debian-test2_20131105_amd64.deb</pre>


<p>And you can use it:</p>


<pre>$ eval $(opam config env --root /opt/opam2debian/opam2debian-test2/)
$ which ocamlfind
 /opt/opam2debian/opam2debian-test2/4.01.0/bin/ocamlfind
$ ocamlfind list
 [...]
 stdlib              (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
 str                 (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
 threads             (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
 threads.posix       (version: [internal])
 threads.vm          (version: [internal])
 type_conv           (version: 109.41.00)
 unidiff             (version: 0.0.2)
 unix                (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
 userconf            (version: 0.3.1)
 xdg-basedir         (version: 0.0.3)
 xmlm                (version: 1.1.1)
 yojson              (version: 1.1.5)</pre>


<p>A nice thing to note, is that it is a standard OPAM install. You can install, update and upgrade OPAM from there, as root. However, I would recommend not to do it, and just rebuild a newer Debian package to upgrade.</p>


<h3>Install</h3>


<p>You will need the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/opam">opam</a> and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/proot">proot</a> Debian package available in Debian jessie and sid. You will also need various OCaml libraries (cmdliner, calendar, fileutils and jingoo).</p>


<p>Download the opam2debian tarball on the <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/?group_id=348">forge</a>, build  and install it.</p>


<p>The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/gildor478/opam2debian">github</a>.</p>


<h3>Open issues</h3>


<p>On the initial list of goals of the project. Not everything is completed. I have still several open issues.</p>


<p>In particular 4. (create snapshot of OPAM repository) was blocked by a bug in opam-mk-repo, that prevents snapshots (see <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/977">my pull-request to solve it</a>).</p>


<p>Another issues is about licenses of the included files. I should list them all and I need to figure out a way to extract every licences.</p>

The answer is short -- just scroll to the last code block -- and may be of interest to some readers.</p>




<h3 id="module-overriding">Module overriding</h3>
<p>The proposed use-case is the following: you want to write code that looks like it uses the module <code>List</code> from the standard library, but in fact the functions <code>hd</code> and <code>tl</code> are the variants that return <code>option</code> values, because you like that style better than catching exceptions.</p>
<p>There is a rather well-known trick to do that, which is to prepend the following code at the beginning of your source, or in a separate <code>My_std</code> module you always open first.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="ot">module</span> List = <span class="kw">struct</span>
  <span class="ot">include</span> List
  <span class="kw">let</span> hd = <span class="kw">function</span>
    | [] -&gt; <span class="dt">None</span>
    | x::_ -&gt; <span class="dt">Some</span> x
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>However, you may run into problem if the definition you want to override is not directly in the module, but some of its submodule. Let's consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="ot">module</span> Toto = <span class="kw">struct</span>
    <span class="kw">let</span> x = 1
    <span class="ot">module</span> Tata = <span class="kw">struct</span>
      <span class="kw">let</span> y = 2
    <span class="kw">end</span>
    <span class="ot">module</span> Titi = <span class="kw">struct</span>

      <span class="kw">let</span> z = 3
    <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Suppose I want to replace <code>Toto.Tata.y</code> to be of type <code>string</code> rather than <code>int</code>. The obvious thing doesn't work.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="ot">module</span> Totoverride = <span class="kw">struct</span>
  <span class="ot">include</span> Toto
  <span class="ot">module</span> Tata = <span class="kw">struct</span>
    <span class="ot">include</span> Toto<span class="kw">.</span>Tata
    <span class="kw">let</span> y = <span class="st">"2"</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>Error: Multiple definition of the module name Tata.
       Names must be unique in a given structure or signature.</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that, while OCaml will let you shadow an existing <code>let</code> declaration, it does not accept declaring other sorts of declarations (types, modules, module types...) twice in the same module. Here a <code>Tata</code> submodule is created in <code>Totoverride</code> first at the <code>include Toto</code> point, and then for a second time explicitly.</p>
<p>One manual solution is to use a signature ascription to remove the <code>Tata</code> submodule from <code>Toto</code> at include time.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="ot">module</span> Totoverride = <span class="kw">struct</span>
  <span class="ot">include</span> (<span class="dt">Toto</span> : <span class="kw">sig</span>
             <span class="kw">val</span> x : <span class="dt">int</span>
             <span class="ot">module</span> Titi : (<span class="kw">sig</span> <span class="kw">val</span> z : <span class="dt">int</span> <span class="kw">end</span>) 
           <span class="kw">end</span>)
  <span class="ot">module</span> Tata = <span class="kw">struct</span>
    <span class="ot">include</span> Toto<span class="kw">.</span>Tata
    <span class="kw">let</span> y = <span class="st">"2"</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The problem with this solution is that you have to repeat most <code>Toto</code>'s signature, which leads to a painful maintenance burden. Not only will changes in <code>Toto</code>'s definition (addition of new fields) require changes in this place, but the compiler will not tell you when such changes happen, <code>Totoverride</code> will just be incomplete with respect to <code>Toto</code>.</p>
<h3 id="module-type-of-and-destructive-substitution"><code>module type of</code> and Destructive substitution</h3>
<p>Destructive substitution (<code>with .. := ...</code>) is a newish feature of the OCaml language, as it was added in 3.12 -- released in summer 2010. The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/extn.html#sec234">documentation in the manual</a> is extremely clear and provides good examples, so if you don't know about it you should just go read it now.</p>
<p><a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/extn.html#sec233"><code>module type of</code></a> was also added in 3.12, and lets you speak about the interface of a module without defining it explicitly: <code>module type of Foo</code> is an interface that <code>Foo</code> satisfies.</p>
<p>There are subtleties about the semantics of both these constructions, so you should not abuse them unless you want to read papers about module systems -- you probably don't -- to understand why your code doesn't type-check. However, they can be combined in a perfectly reasonable way to remove some type or submodules of a module at inclusion time: <code>module type of Foo with type t := Foo.t</code> is the signature of <code>Foo</code>, minus the type <code>t</code>, and the same thing works for <code>with module</code>. This lets us solve our module overriding problem:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="ot">module</span> Totoverride = <span class="kw">struct</span>
  <span class="ot">include</span> (<span class="dt">Toto</span> : <span class="ot">module</span> <span class="kw">type</span> <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">Toto</span> <span class="kw">with</span> <span class="ot">module</span> Tata := Toto<span class="kw">.</span><span class="dt">Tata</span>)
  <span class="ot">module</span> Tata = <span class="kw">struct</span>
    <span class="ot">include</span> Toto<span class="kw">.</span>Tata
    <span class="kw">let</span> y = <span class="st">"2"</span>
  <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="completeness-is-always-hard">Completeness is always hard</h3>
<p>This is a neat trick to have in your toolbox, but you should know that it may not satisfy all your module overriding drives. You can remove type and module from a signature, but there are a lot of other OCaml signature items that don't have a corresponding destructive subtitution: module types, classes, class types and exceptions.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's not always clear what the intended semantics of destructive substitution should be. For example, I'm not really sure what destructive substitution of exception declarations would mean -- exceptions are a kind of blind spot as they don't appear in types. But in any case, if you try to override everything, you'll run into this incompleteness and go add your lament to <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5460">the feature request PR#5460</a>, "Replace/rename/remove module types".</p>
<p>To be honest, the signature language grows pieces by pieces as needs are justified (and semantics are understood), so it's not particularly surprising that it is not complete. There was a notable attempt by Norman Ramsey in 2001 to think about what a more self-sufficient signature languages should be, <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/pubs/sigcalc.ps">Towards a Calculus of Signatures</a> -- with, I just found out, a draft implementation by <a href="http://www.pfitzenmaier.de/sigcalc.html">Jürgen Pfitzenmaier</a>). The good news is that probably the most important construct (destructive substitution of types) has been integrated since, but otherwise things are going at their own pace.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#9fc76b93fd89f2e19976096b468d4495">Hide</a></div></span>

<p>We’ve made a <strong><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/tree/redesign">new branch</a></strong> on the main ocaml.org repository with the redesign. This branch is a fork of the master and we’ve simply cleaned up and replayed our git commits there.</p>

<p>During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on the master branch but would be happy to accept them on the new, redesign branch. Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.</p>

<p>Please note that the above is only intended to merge the <em>design</em> and <em>toolchain</em> for the new site. Specifically, we’ve created new landing pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site’s contents as well as made some new libraries (<a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html">OMD</a> and <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-39-07-OPAMaging-MPP.html">MPP</a>). The new toolchain means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a lot easier.</p>

<p>Since the files are on GitHub, people don’t even need to clone the site locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the ‘Edit this page’ link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the repository and GitHub’s editing and pull request features will allow you to make changes and submit updates, all from within your browser (see the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository">GitHub Article</a> for details).</p>

<p>There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed by the OCaml community and merged.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post8','post7')" class="btn" href="#a71b4294da2067aa511bdbf21edf6438">Hide</a></div></span>

So pricing a book between between $10 and $20 makes no sense. I priced the book roughly the same as the print one, and signed up for MatchBook.

There were no sales for the first two days, but I know that sinking feeling from other projects and was prepared for it. Then sales started trickling in. I sent off review copies to the Journal of Functional Programming and a couple of bloggers.</p><p>This is, so far as I can remember, the sum total of active marketing effort so far. </p><h2>Legal and financial issues</h2><p>Both CreateSpace and Amazon Kindle will, by default, give 30% of your net earnings to the IRS unless you can prove you are not a US citizen and your country has an appropriate tax treaty. This is relatively easy to deal with if you publish through an existing corporation like I did, but apparently individuals have to jump through more hoops.  There is lots of conflicting information about these issues online. If you don't get it done in time, claiming the already-withheld money is hard too.</p><p></p><p>A bright spot is that there is a real direct email address with a real human at Amazon for dealing with this tax issue, and the Kindle and CreateSpace systems are linked so that, upon request, paperwork relating to the tax status of one can be transferred to the other. </p><p>I also had to deposit six copies of the printed book with copyright libraries in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, as a condition of using the ISBN.  Each country will have its own rules.</p><h2>Up-front costs</h2><ul><li>ISBNs (Pack of 10) $201</li><li>Postage of free copies to draft reviewers etc. $80</li><li>Proofs from CreateSpace with expedited shipping to the UK $134</li><li>25 copies for friends and so on, with expedited shipping $149</li><li>Stock photographs for cover and website $40</li></ul><p>Total <strong>$604. </strong>You could use a CreateSpace-assigned ISBN for free, get fewer proofs, and buy fewer sample copies and get this total down to about $150<strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><span></span></p><h2>Running costs</h2><p></p><p><a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> web hosting, $8 per month. <a href="http://www.e-junkie.com">E-junkie</a> for processing and content delivery of PDF eBook, $5 per month. Total <strong>$13</strong> per month. In theory, you could roll all this yourself for $0.</p><h2>Sales figures</h2><ul><li>June 7th-30th | Amazon 21, PDF eBook 13, Kindle 3 | Total net <strong>$652</strong></li><li>July | Amazon 12, PDF eBook 6, Kindle 15 | Total net <strong>$505</strong></li><li>August | Amazon 18, PDF eBook 9, Kindle 9 | Total net <strong>$603</strong></li><li>September | Amazon 24, PDF eBook 15, Kindle 9 | Total net <strong>$812</strong></li><li>October | Amazon 26, PDF eBook 20, Kindle 8 | Total net <strong>$912</strong></li></ul><p>It's hard to say how many copies will be sold in the next few years. There is another excellent OCaml book out soon (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do">Real World OCaml</a> from O'Reilly), and things change with time. <span>However, should it sell a few hundred dollars a month steadily for the next five or ten years, I would consider it to be very decent pay for the work involved.</span></p><p>For comparison, here are the last five months' royalty payments from O'Reilly for PDF Explained: $99, $123, $99, $38, $109. (PDF Explained sells 50 - 100 copies a month, but is a smaller, cheaper book).  </p><p><span></span></p><h2>Some Advantages of traditional publishers</h2><p></p><ul><li>Traditional publishers might give you an advance on royalties (though I didn't get an advance from O'Reilly)</li><li><span>Traditional publishers will invest in translated editions (PDF Explained has been translated into Portuguese (Brazil) and Japanese). I will have to decide about, arrange, and pay for, translations for OCaml from the Very Beginning.</span></li><li><span></span><span>Traditional publishers have extra sales channels (I get part of a cent every time someone looks at a page of PDF Explained on <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com">Safari</a>, for example).</span></li><li>Traditional publishers will proof-read and edit the book and sometimes deal with things like indexing (though I had to write my own index for PDF Explained). To produce a book without an editor, you need to work hard and proof-read again and again.</li></ul><p></p><h2>Lessons</h2><p></p><ul><li>There is real money (as opposed to beer money) to be made, even if it's a niche book, so long as it sells consistently, and sales continue for several years. </li><li>Books require less maintenance than software, especially if written with that in mind (there's not a single URL in the book, and since it's a beginner's book, very little which might change). </li><li><span>If you can write and format a high quality book, the publishing side is really not hard at all in comparison. Once set up, the running costs and administration are trivial.</span></li></ul><p>At some point the industry might change such that it's not possible to earn $21 clear profit from a paperback textbook sale but until then, there's money to be made.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><a onclick="switchContent('post10','post9')" class="btn" href="#737918f3f7de75aff5c248083da4fc44">Hide</a></div></span>

<p>Nice, isn’t it? Our question was: if we can so beautifully go from typed syntax (expressions) to typed semantics (OCaml values), can we do the converse, i.e., go from an OCaml value back to a (normal) expression of the same type? In other words, can we implement NbE in a typeful manner, using GADTs?</p>
<p>The answer is a proud “yes”, but more interestingly, we all learned some interesting GADT techniques and puzzling logical interpretations on the way. Read on to know more!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://cs.au.dk/~mpuech/typeful.pdf"><strong>Tagless and Typeful Normalization by Evaluation using Generalized Algebraic Data Types</strong></a></p>
<p>We present the first tagless and typeful implementation of normalization by evaluation for the simply typed λ-calculus in OCaml, using Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs). In contrast to normalization by reduction, which is operationally carried out by repeated instances of one-step reduction, normalization by evaluation uses a non-standard model to internalize intermediate results: it is defined by composing a non-standard evaluation function with a reification function that maps the denotation of a term into the normal form of this term. So far, normalization by evaluation has been implemented either in dependently-typed languages such as Coq or Agda, or in general-purpose languages such as Scheme, ML or Haskell. In the latter case, denotations are either tagged or Church-encoded. Tagging means injecting denotations, either implicitly or explicitly, into a universal domain of values; Church encoding is based on the impredicativity of the metalanguage. Here, we show how to obtain not only tagless values, making evaluation efficient, but also typeful reification, guaranteeing type preservation and η-long, β-normal forms. To this end, we put OCaml’s GADTs to work. Furthermore, our implementation does not depend on any particular representation of binders (HOAS, de Bruijn levels or indices) nor on the style (direct style, continuation-passing style, etc.) of the non-standard evaluation function.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial at the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24">FPDays</a> conference (an event for people interested in Functional Programming). <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and I led the session with <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David</a> and <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.</p>
<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
<p>It turned out to be by far the <em>most popular session</em> at the conference with over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml! An excellent turnout and a great indicator of the interest that’s out there, especially when you offer a hands-on session to people. This shouldn’t be a surprise as we’ve had good attendance for the general <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/">OCaml meetups</a> I’ve run and also the <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html">compiler hacking sessions</a>, which Jeremy and Leo have been building up (do sign up if you’re interested in either of those!). We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">uncorrected proof</a> copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just enough to go around.</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people could dive in quickly. The event was set up to be really informal and the rough plan was as following:</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people could dive in quickly. The event was set up to be really informal and the rough plan was as following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Installation/Intro</em> - We checked that people had been able to follow the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/">installation instructions</a>, which we’d sent them in advance. We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable with <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Hello world</em> - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Monty Hall browser game</em> - Using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"><code>js_of_ocaml</code></a>, we wanted people to create and run the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> in their browser. This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by having to deal with the DOM and interfaces. If folks did well, they could add code to keep logs of the game results.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Client-server game</em> - The previous game was all in the browser (so could be examined by players) so here the task was to split it into a client and server, ensuring the two stay in sync. This would demonstrate the re-usability of the OCaml code already written and give people a feel for client server interactions. If people wanted to do more, they could use <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/ctypes/0.1.1/">ctypes</a> and get better random numbers.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We did manage to stick to the overall scheme as above and we think this is a great base from which to improve future tutorials. It has the really nice benefit of having visual, interactive elements and the ability to run things both in the browser as well as on the server is a great way to show the versatility of OCaml. <code>js_of_ocaml</code> is quite a mature tool and so it’s no surprise that it’s also used by companies such as Facebook (see the recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWNjFagR9k">CUFP talk by Julien Verlaguet</a> - skip to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1149">19:00</a>).</p>

<p>We learned a lot from running this session so we’ve captured the good, the bad and the ugly below. This is useful for anyone who’d like to run an OCaml tutorial in the future and also for us to be aware of the next time we do this. I’ve incorporated the feedback from the attendees as well as our own thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="things_we_learnt">Things we learnt</h3>

<h4 id="the_good">The Good</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Most people really did follow the install instructions beforehand. This made things so much easier on the day as we didn’t have to worry about compile times and people getting bored. A few people had even got in touch with me the night before to sort out installation problems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Many folks from OCaml Labs also came over to help people, which meant no-one was waiting longer than around 10 seconds before getting help.</p>

<li>
<p>We had a good plan of the things we wanted to cover but we were happy to be flexible and made it clear the aim was to get right into it. Several folks told us that they really appreciated this loose (as opposed to rigid) structure.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We didn’t spend any time lecturing the room but instead got people right into the code. Having enough of a skeleton to get something interesting working was a big plus in this regard. People did progress from the early examples to the later ones fairly well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We had a VM with the correct set up that we could log people into if they were having trouble locally. Two people made use of this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Of course, It was great to have early proofs of the book and these were well-received.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the_bad">The Bad</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In our excitement to get right into the exercises, we didn’t really give an overview of OCaml and its benefits. A few minutes at the beginning would be enough and it’s important so that people can leave with a few sound-bites.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not everyone received my email about installation, and certainly not the late arrivals. This meant some pain getting things downloaded and running especially due to the wifi (see ‘Ugly’ below).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A few of the people who <em>had</em> installed, didn’t complete the instructions fully but didn’t realise this until the morning of the session. There was a good suggestion about having some kind of test to run that would check everything, so you’d know if there was something missing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We really should have had a cut-off where we told people to use VMs instead of fixing installation issues and 10-15 minutes would have been enough. This would have been especially useful for the late-comers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We didn’t really keep a record of the problems folks were having so we can’t now go back and fix underlying issues. To be fair, this would have been a little awkward to do ad-hoc but in hindsight, it’s a good thing to plan for.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the_ugly">The Ugly</h4>

<ul>
<li>The only ugly part was the wifi. It turned out that the room itself was a bit of a dead-spot and that wasn’t helped by 30ish devices trying to connect to one access point! Having everyone grab packages at the same time in the morning probably didn’t help. It was especially tricky as all our mitigation plans seemed to revolve around at least having local connectivity. In any case, this problem only lasted for the morning session and was a little better by the afternoon. I’d definitely recommend a backup plan in the case of complete wifi failure next time! One such plan that Leo got started on was to put the repository and other information onto a flash drive that could be shared with people. We didn’t need this in the end but it’ll be useful to have something like this prepared for next time. If anyone fancies donating a bunch of flash drives, I’ll happily receive them!</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, it was a great session and everyone left happy, having completed most of the tutorial (and with a book!). A few even continued at home afterwards and <a href="https://twitter.com/richardclegg/status/393458073052139520">got in touch</a> to let us know that they got everything working. It was a great session and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacquiDDavidson">Jacqui</a> and the rest of the FPDays crew for a great conference!</p>
