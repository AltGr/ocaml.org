You also need libraries, and there are many developers all over the world providing them; you can go and pick them up. But it is a lot of work to build and install them. </p> <p>GODI is a system that simplifies this task: It is a framework that automatically builds the O’Caml core system, and additionally installs a growing number of pre-packaged libraries. For a number of reasons GODI is a source-code based system, and there are no precompiled libraries, but it makes it very simple for everybody to compile them. </p> <p>GODI is available for O’Caml-3.10 and 3.11. It runs on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Windows (Cygwin and MinGW), HP-UX, MacOS X. </p></blockquote></span>

OSCON is in its 15th year now, and is a meeting place for developers, business people and investors. It was a great opportunity to show MirageOS off to some of the movers and shakers in the OSS world.</p><p>Partly because MirageOS is about synthesising extremely specialised guest kernels from high-level code, and partly because both Anil and I are constitutionally incapable of taking the easy way out, we self-hosted the slide deck on Mirage: after some last-minute hacking -- on content not Mirage I should add! -- we built a self-contained microkernel of the talk.</p><p>This was what you might call a "full stack" presentation: the custom microkernel (flawlessly!) ran a type-safe <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/blob/master/xen/lib/netif.ml">network device driver</a>, OCaml <a href="http://github.com/mirage/mirage-net">TCP/IP stack</a> supporting an OCaml <a href="http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">HTTP</a> framework that served slides rendered using <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a>. The slide deck, including the turbo-boosted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mx8Bd5JYyo">screencast</a> of the slide deck compilation, is hosted as another MirageOS virtual machine at <a href="http://decks.openmirage.org/">decks.openmirage.org</a>. We hope to add more slide decks there soon, including resurrecting the tutorial! The source code for all this is in the <a href="http://github.com/mirage/mirage-decks">mirage-decks</a> GitHub repo.</p><h3><a name="h3-TheTalk" class="anchor-toc"> The Talk</a></h3><p>The talk went down pretty well -- given we were in a graveyard slot on Friday after many people had left, attendance was fairly high (around 30-40), and the <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28956">feedback scores</a> have been positive (averaging 4.7/5) with comments including "excellent content and well done" and "one of the most excited projects I heard about" (though we are suspicious that just refers to Anil's usual high-energy presentation style...).</p><p>&lt;iframe align="right" allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="235" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Mx8Bd5JYyo" style="margin-left: 10px;" width="420"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;</p><p>Probably the most interesting chat after the talk was with the Rust authors at Mozilla (<a href="http://twitter.com/pcwalton">@pcwalton</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brson">@brson</a>) about combining the Mirage <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">unikernel</a> techniques with the <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> runtime. But perhaps the most surprising feedback was when Anil and I were stopped in the street while walking back from some well-earned sushi, by a cyclist who loudly declared that he'd really enjoyed the talk and thought it was a really exciting project -- never done something that achieved public acclaim from the streets before :)</p><h3><a name="h3-BookSigningandXen.org" class="anchor-toc"> Book Signing and Xen.org</a></h3><p>Anil also took some time to sit in a book signing for his forthcoming <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a> O'Reilly book. This is really important to making OCaml easier to learn, especially given that all the Mirage libraries are using it. Most of the dev team (and especially thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360">Heidi Howard</a> who bravely worked through really early alpha revisions) have been giving us feedback as the book is written, using the online commenting system.</p><p>The Xen.org booth was also huge, and we spent quite a while plotting the forthcoming Mirage/Xen/ARM backend. We're pretty much just waiting for the <a href="http://cubieboard.org">Cubieboard2</a> kernel patches to be upstreamed (keep an eye <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/Main_Page">here</a>) so that we can boot Xen/ARM VMs on tiny ARM devices. There's a full report about this on the <a href="http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2013/07/31/the-xen-project-at-oscon/">xen.org</a> blog post about OSCon.</p><h3><a name="h3-GaloisandHalVM" class="anchor-toc"> Galois and HalVM</a></h3><p>We also stopped by the <a href="http://corp.galois.com">Galois</a> to chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/acwpdx">Adam Wick</a>, who is the leader of the <a href="http://corp.galois.com/halvm">HalVM</a> project at Galois. This is a similar project to Mirage, but, since it's written in Haskell, has more of a focus on elegant compositional semantics rather than the more brutal performance and predictability that Mirage currently has at its lower levels.</p><p>The future of all this ultimately lies in making it easier for these multi-lingual unikernels to be managed and for all of them to communicate more easily, so we chatted about code sharing and common protocols (such as <a href="https://github.com/vbmithr/ocaml-vchan">vchan</a>) to help interoperability. Expect to see more of this once our respective implementations get more stable.</p><p>All-in-all OSCON'13 was a fun event and definitely one that we look forward returning to with a more mature version of MirageOS, to build on the momentum begun this year! Portland was an amazing host city too, but what happens in Portland, stays in Portland...</p><a onclick="switchContent('post2','post1')" class="btn" href="#756e264c4351dde937cc7ed3553eaf6e">Hide</a></div></span>

We realize that reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited feedback! The book is now a week away from being handed over to the O’Reilly production team for copyediting, so the window for changes are limited after that. Comments reset between milestones and so beta2 is a clean slate; we’re still working through some remaining older issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.</p> </li> <li> <p>All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated. The source code is as close to public domain as practical, at: <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples">https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples</a></p> </li> <li> <p>The final version will have the installation chapter moved to be online only, and we intend to publish updates there to elaborate on installation and packaging mechanisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exercises will be available after we go into production, and also only be available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenting system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our readers on an ongoing basis.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There’s been quite a bit of feedback and conversation about the book, so this also seemed like a good point to checkpoint the process somewhat.</p> <h2 id="crowd_sourcing_community_feedback">Crowd sourcing community feedback</h2> <a href="http://realworldocaml.org"><img src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/oreilly-cover.gif" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;"/></a> <p><em>Good</em>: The decision to crowdsource feedback has been exhausting but very worthwhile, with over 2,200 <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">comments</a> posted (and over 2,000 resolved by us too!). O’Reilly has a similar platform called <a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com">Atlas</a> that wasn’t quite ready when we started our book, but I’d highly encourage new authors to go down this route and not stick with a traditional editorial scheme.</p> <p>It’s simply not possible for a small group of technical reviewers to notice as many errors as the wider community has. Having said this, it’s interesting how much more focussed and critical the comments of our editor <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/andyo">Andy Oram</a> were when compared to most of the wider community feedback, so the commenting system is definitely a complement and not a replacement to the editorial process.</p> <h3 id="the_github_requirement">The GitHub requirement</h3> <p><em>Bad</em>: After the first beta, we got criticized on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5893168">Hacker News</a> thread for passing around Github oAuth tokens without SSL. This was entirely my fault, and I corrected the site to be pure-SSL within 24 hours.</p> <p><em>Ugly</em>: In my defence though, I <em>dont want</em> the authority that all the reviewers have granted to me for their Github accounts! We need just two things to enable commenting: an identity service to cut down on spam comments, and the ability to create issues in a <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">public repository</a>. Unfortunately, Github’s <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">scope</a> API requires you to also grant us access to commit to public code repositories. Add on the fact that around 6,000 people have clicked through the oAuth API to review RWO, and you start to see just how much code we potentially have access to. I did try to reduce the damage by not actually storing the oAuth tokens on the server-side. Instead, we store it in the client using a secure cookie, so you can easily reset your browser to log out.</p> <p>It’s not just about authentication either: another reader <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ocaml/comments/1gil84/public_beta_of_real_world_ocaml/cal811r">points out</a> that if they use GitHub during work hours, they have no real way of separating the news streams that result.</p> <p>Much of the frustration here is that there’s nothing I can do to fix this except wait for GitHub to hopefully improve their service. I very much hope that GitHub is listening to this and has internal plans to overhaul their privilege management APIs.</p> <h3 id="infrastructurefree_hosting">Infrastructure-free hosting</h3> <p><em>Good</em> and <em>Bad</em>: One of my goals with the commenting infrastructure was to try and eliminate all server-side code, so that we could simply publish the book onto Github Pages and use JavaScript for the comment creation and listing.</p> <p>This <em>almost</em> worked out. We still need a tiny HTTP proxy for comment creation, as we add contextual information such as a milestone to every new comment to make it easier to index. Setting a milestone requires privileged access to the repository and so our server-side proxy creates the issue using the user-supplied oAuth token (so that it originates from the commenter), and then updates it (via the <a href="http://github.com/bactrian">bactrian</a> account) to add the milestone add insert a little contextual comment pointing back to the book paragraph where the comment originated from.</p> <p><em>Good</em>: The other criticism from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gipea/first_public_beta_of_real_world_ocaml_book/cakmeuz">online feedback</a> was the <em>requirement</em> to have a Github login to read the book at all. This is a restriction that we intend to lift for the final release (which will be freely available online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">CC-BY-NC-ND</a> license), but I think it’s absolutely the right decision to gateway early adopters to get useful feedback. Even if we lost 90% of our potential reviewers through the Github auth wall, I don’t think we could have coped with another 10,000 comments in any case.</p> <p>On the positive side, we didn’t have a single spam comment or other abuses of the commenting system at all.</p> <p>I’ve had quite a few queries been open-sourcing the <a href="http://github.com/realworldocaml/scripts">scripts</a> that drive the server-side commenting, and this on my TODO list for after the final book has gone to production.</p> <h2 id="autogenerating_the_examples">Auto-generating the examples</h2> <p><em>Bad</em>: We tried for far too long during the book writing to stumble through with manual installation instructions and hand-copied code snippets and outputs. Some of our alpha reviewers pointed out <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues/236">vociferously</a> that spending time on installation and dealing with code typos was not a good use of their time.</p> <p><em>Good</em>: <a href="http://bolinfest.com">Michael Bolin</a> was entirely correct in his criticism (and incidentally, one of our most superstar reviewers). The latest beta has an entirely mechanically generated toolchain that lets us regenerate the entire book output from a cold start by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples">examples</a> repository. In retrospect, I should have written this infrastructure a year ago, and I’d recommend any new books of this sort focus hard on automation from the early days.</p> <p>Luckily, my automation <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/scripts">scripts</a> could crib heavily from existing open-source OCaml projects that had portions of what we needed, such as <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop">uTop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> (and my thanks to <a href="https://github.com/diml">Jeremie Dimino</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Chris00">Christophe Troestler</a> for their help here).</p> <p><em>Awesome</em>: We’re hacking on a little surprise for the final online version of the book, based on this build infrastructure. Stay <a href="http://try.ocamlpro.com">tuned</a>!</p><a onclick="switchContent('post4','post3')" class="btn" href="#2895e571d9df92eaff657637a147984b">Hide</a></div></span>

First, Pierre Chambart polished the prototype implementation of his new <code>flamba</code> intermediate language and he started to get impressive <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/07/11/inlining-progress-report.html">micro-benchmarks results</a>, with around 20% - 30% improvements on code using exceptions or functors. Following a discussion with our industrial users, he is currently focusing on improving the compilation of local recursive functions such as the very typical:</p><pre><code>let f x y = let rec loop v = ... x ... loop z in loop x </code></pre><p>A simple and reasonably efficient solutions is to eta-expand the auxiliary function, i.e. add an intermediate function calling the loop with all closure parameters passed as variables. The hard part is to then to add the right arguments to all the call sites: luckily enough the new inlining engine already does that kind of analysis so it can be re-used here. This means that these constructs will be compiled efficiently by the new inlining heuristics.</p><p>Second, Luca Saiu has finished debugging the native thread support on top of his <a href="https://github.com/lucasaiu/ocaml">multi-runtime variant of OCaml</a>, which has become quite usable and is pretty robust now. He has tentatively started adding support for <code>vmthreads</code> as well, concurrently cleaning up context finalization and solving other minor issues, such as configuration scripts for architectures that do not support the multi-runtime features yet. Then, after writing documentation and running a full pass over the sources to remove debugging stubs and prints which pollute the code after months of low-level experimentation, he is going to prepare patches for discussion and submission to the main OCaml compiler.</p><p>Çagdas Bozman continued to improve the implementation of his <a href="https://github.com/cago/ocaml">profiling tools</a> for both native and byte-code programs. A great output of his recent work is that the location information is much more precise: with very different techniques for native and byte code, the program locations are now uniquely identified. The usability was improved as well, as the profiling location tables are now embedded directly into the programs. He also improved the post-mortem profiling tools to re-type dumped heaps, which also leads to much more accurate profiling information. Çagdas is now actively using these tools on <a href="http://why3.lri.fr/">why3</a> and he expects to get feedback results very soon to continue to improve his tools.</p><p>Finally, Thomas Blanc is still working on whole program analysis for his internship, in order to find possibly uncaught exceptions. The project is moving quite well and the month was spent on analyzing the lambda intermediate representation of the compilation step. With the help of Pierre Chambart, he is working on a <a href="https://github.com/thomasblanc/ocaml-data-analysis">0-CFA library</a> that should allow to compute the "possible" values for each variable at each point of the program. The idea is to make a directed hypergraph with each hyperedge representing an instruction and each vertex being a state of the program. Then search a fixpoint in the possible values propagated through the graph. This allows the compiler to know everywhere in the program what possible values may be returned or what possible exceptions may be raised. In order to create a well-designed graph, it is needed to create a new intermediate representation that looks like Lambda except (mainly) that every expression gets an identifier. The next step is to specify a hypergraph construction for each primitive and control-flow.</p><h2>Development Tools</h2><h3>Editors</h3><p>This month, Louis Gesbert has been busy making the first release of <a href="http://www.typerex.org/ocaml-top.html">ocaml-top</a>, the simple graphical top-level for beginners and students. Together with the web-IDE, this project aims at lowering the entry barrier to OCaml. Ocaml-top features a clean and easy to access interface, with nonetheless advanced features like automatic semantic indentation, error marking, and integrated display of standard library types -- using the engines of <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-index">ocp-index</a> of course. The biggest challenge was probably to make everything work as expected on Microsoft Windows, which was required for most beginners and classrooms. The two main issues were:</p><p></p><p><img src="http://www.typerex.org/ocaml-top-resources/screenshot_1.png" alt="ocaml-top" width="720px"/></p><p></p><ul> <li> <p>Setup the build environment: there are several versions of OCaml for Windows ; we generally want to avoid any dependency on cygwin on the generated program, but it's very hard to avoid any need for it in the build chain. The easiest solution at the moment is to "cross-compile" from cygwin using the mingw32 gcc compiler. The hard part is to get all the needed libraries properly setup: this felt a lot like Linux 15 years ago, you can find some binaries but generally not properly configured, and there is no consistent packaging system (or at least you can't find what you want in it).</p> </li><li> <p>Process management: ocaml-top runs the OCaml toplevel as a sub-process, so as not to be inpaired by any problem in the user program. Interacting with that process in a portable way is close to impossible, Windows having no POSIX signals, and read/write operations being very different in terms of blocking, etc. Some obscure C bindings were required to simulate a SIGINT that could tell the ocaml process to stop the current computation and return to the prompt. But at this cost, ocaml-top can be run with any existing external OCaml toplevel.</p> </li> </ul><p>Not mentioning some gtk/lablgtk bugs that were often OS-specific. After having read <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/gagallium/the-ocaml-installer-for-windows/">horror stories</a> about the most commonly used "Windows installer generator" <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NSIS</a>, Louis opted for the Microsoft open source solution <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX</a> which turned out to be quite clean and efficient, although using a lot of XML. The only point that might be in favor of NSIS is that it can generate the installer from Linux, so it's much convenient when you cross-compile, which is not the case here ; also worth mentioning, Xen and LVM are really great tools which do save a lot of time when working and testing between two (or more) different OSes.</p><p>Always on the editor front, David and Pierrick have been working on a web-IDE for OCaml since the beginning of their internship two months ago. For now, the IDE includes <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace</a>, an editor, plugged with some features specific for OCaml, particularly <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a>, made possible by using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/">js_of_ocaml</a> which compiles bytecode to Javascript. It also includes a basic project manager that uses a server to store files for each user. Authentication is done by using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla's Persona</a>. One particularly nice feature they are working on is <i>client-side</i> bytecode generation: this means users can ask their browser to produce the byte-code of the project they are working on <i>without any connection to the server</i> ! Beware that this is still work-in-progress and the feature is not bug-free for the moment. The project (undocumented for now) is available on <a href="https://github.com/pcouderc/ocp-webedit">Github</a>.</p><h3> Tools</h3><p>Meanwhile, most of my time last month has been spent preparing the next release of OPAM, with the help of Louis Gesbert. This new release will contain a <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues?milestone=17&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">lot of bug-fixes</a> and an improved <code>opam update</code> mechanism: it will be much more flexible, faster and more stable than the one present in <code>1.0</code>. Few months ago, I had already pushed a <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/pull/597">first batch of patches</a> to the development version, which started to make things look much better. I decided last month to continue improving that feature and make it rock-solid: hence I have started a <a href="https://github.com/samoht/opam-rt">regression testing platform for OPAM</a> which is still young but already damn useful to stabilize my new <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/pull/719">set of patches</a>. <code>opam-rt</code> is also written in OCaml: it generates random repositories with random packages, shuffles everything around and checks that OPAM correctly picks-up the changes. In the future this will make it easier to test complex OPAM scenarios and will hopefully lead to a better OPAM.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-index">ocp-index</a> has seen some progress, with lots of rough edges rounded, and much better performance on big <code>cmi</code> files (typically module packs, like <code>Core.Std</code>). While more advanced functionality is being planned, it is already very helpful, and problems seen in earlier development versions have been fixed. The upcoming release also greatly improves the experience from emacs, and might become the first "stable". The flow of bugs reported on <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-index">ocp-indent</a> is drying up, which means the tool is gaining some maturity. Not much visible changes for the past month except for a few bug-fixes, but the library interface has been completely rewritten to offer much more flexibility while being more friendly. This has allowed it to be plugged in the Web-IDE (see above), which being executed in JavaScript has much tighter performance constraints -- the indent engine is only re-run where required after changes -- ; and in ocaml-top, where it is also used to detect top-level phrase bounds.</p><h2>Community</h2><p>We are proud to be well represented at the <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/program.html">OCaml Developer Workshop 2013</a>. This year it happens in Boston, in September, co-located with the <a href="http://cufp.org/conference/schedule/2013">Conference of Users of Functional Programming</a>. Both conferences will contains a lot of OCaml-related talks: I am especially excited to hear about <a href="http://cufp.org/conference/schedule/2013">PHP type-inference efforts</a> at Facebook using OCaml! If you are in the area around the 22/23 and 24 of September and you want to chat about OCamlPro and OCaml, we will be around!</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#141badefecc893bf03e7aae299c52c16">Hide</a></div></span>
