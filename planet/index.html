As usual, we worked in three main areas: the OCaml toolchain, development tools for OCaml and R&amp;D projects.</p><h2>The toolchain</h2><p>Our multi-runtime implementation of OCaml had gained stability. <a href="http://ageinghacker.net/">Luca</a> fixed a lot of low-level bugs in the "master" branch of <a href="http://www.github.com/lucasaiu/ocaml">his OCaml repository</a>, which were mainly related to the handling of signals. There are still some issues, which seem to be related to thread-switching (ie. when using OS level mutli-threading).</p><p>We made great progress on improved inlining strategy. In the current OCaml compiler, inlining, closure conversion and constant propagation are done in a single pass interleaved with analysis. It has served well until now, but to improve it in a way which is easily extensible in the future, it needs a complete rewrite. After a few prototypes, <a href="http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~chambart/">Pierre</a> is now coming up with a suitable intermediate language (IR) more suited for the job, using a dedicated value analysis to guide the simplification and inlining passes. This IR will stand between the lambda code and the C-lambda and is designed such that future specialized optimization can be easily be added. There are two good reasons for this IR: First, it is not as intrusive and reduces the extent of the modifications to the compiler, as it can be plugged between two existing passes and turned on or off using a command-line flag. Second, it can be tweaked to make the abstract interpretation more precise and efficient. For instance, we want the inlining to work with higher-order functions as well as modules and functors, performing basic defunctorization. It is still in an experimentation phase, but we are quickly converging on the API and hope to have something we can demo in the next months.</p><p>Our <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2012/08/08/profile-native-code.html">frame-pointer patch</a> has also been accepted. Note that, as this patch changes the calling sconvention of OCaml programs, you cannot link together libraries compiled with and without the patch. Hence, this option will be provided as a configuration switch (<code>./configure --with-frame-pointer</code>).</p><p>Regarding memory profiling, we released a preliminary prototype of the memory profiler for native code. It is available in <a href="https://github.com/cago/ocaml">Çagdas</a> repository. We are still in the process of testing and evaluating the prototype before making it widely available through OPAM. As the previous bytecode prototype, you need to compile the libraries and the program you want to profile as usual in order to build a table associating unique identifier to program locations (.prof file). Then, for each allocated block, we have then patched the runtime of OCaml to encode in the header the identifier of the line which allocated it. To be able to dump the heap, you can either instrument your program, or send a signal, or set the appropriate environment variable (<code>OCAMLRUNPARAM=m</code>). Finally, you can use the profiler which will read the .prof and .cmt files in order to generate a pdf file which is the amount of memory use by type. More details on this will come soon, you can already read the <a href="https://github.com/cago/ocaml/blob/4.00.1%2Bmemprof/README">README</a> file available on github.</p><p>Finally, we organized a new meeting with the core-team to discuss some of the bugs in the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis">OCaml bug tracker</a>. It was the first of the year, but we are now going to have one every month, as it has a very positive impact on the involvement of everybody in fixing bugs and helps focus work on the most important issues.</p><h2>Development Tools for OCaml</h2><p>Since the latest release of <a href="http://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a>, <a href="http://louis.gesbert.fr/cv.en.html">Louis</a> continued to improve the tool. We plan to release version 1.2.0 in the next couple of days, with some bug fixes (esp. related to the handling of records) and the following new features: operators are now aligned by default (as well as opened parentheses not finishing a line) and indentation can be bounded using the <code>max_indent</code> parameter. We are also using the great <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner">cmdliner</a> which means <code>ocp-indent</code> now has nice manual pages.</p><p>We are also preparing a new minor release of <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com/">OPAM</a>, with a few bug fixes, an improved solver heuristic and improved performance. OPAM statistics seem to converge towards round numbers, as <a href="http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam">OcamlPro/opam</a> repository has recently reached 100 "stars" on Github, <a href="http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository">OCamlPro/opam-repository</a> is not very far from being forked 100 times, while the number of unique packages on <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">opam.ocamlpro.com</a> is almost 400. We are also preparing the platform release, with a cleaner and simpler client API to be used by the upcoming "Ocamlot", the automated infrastructure which will test and improve the quality and consistency of OPAM packages.</p><p>Last, we released a very small - but already incredibly useful tool: <a href="http://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-index">ocp-index</a>. This new tool provides completion based on what is installed on your system, with type and documentation when available. Similarly to <code>ocp-indent</code>, the main goal of this tool is to make it easy to integrate in your editor of choice. As a proof of concept, we also distribute a small curses-based tool, called <code>ocp-browser</code>, which lets you browse interactively the libraries installed on your system, as well as an emacs binding for <code>auto-complete.el</code>. Interestingly enough, behind the scene <code>ocp-index</code> uses a <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-index/blob/master/src/trie.mli">lazy immutable prefix tree</a> with merge operations to efficiently store and load cmis and cmt files.</p><h2>Other R&amp;D Projects</h2><p>We continued to work on the <a href="http://www.richelieu.pro/">Richelieu</a> project. We are currently adding basic type-inference for Scilab programs to our tool <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/richelieu/tree/jit-fabrice/scilab/modules/jit_ocaml/src/scilint">scilint</a>, to be able to print warnings on possible programers mistakes. A first part of the work was to understand how to automatically get rid of some of the <code>eval</code> constructs, especially <code>deff</code> and <code>evalstr</code> primitives that are often used. After this, <a href="https://github.com/Michaaell">Michael</a> manually analyzed some real-world Scilab programs to understand how typing should be done, and he is now implementing the type checker and a table of types for primitive functions.</p><p>We are also submitting a new project, called SOCaml, for funding by the French government. In 2010, <a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/">ANSSI</a>, the French agency for the security of computer systems, commanded a study, called LAFOSEC, to understand the advantages of using functional languages in the domain of security. Early results of the study were presented in <a href="http://jfla.inria.fr/2013/programme">JFLA'2013</a>, with in particular recommandations on how to improve OCaml to use it for security applications. The goal of the SOCaml project would be to implement these recommandations, to improve OCaml, to provide additional tools to detect potential errors and to implement libraries to verify marshaled values and bytecode. We hope the project will be accepted, as it opens a new application domain for OCaml, and would allow us to work on this topic with our partners in the project, such as <a href="http://www.lexifi.com">LexiFi</a> and <a href="http://michel.mauny.net/">Michel Mauny</a>'s team at ENSTA Paristech (the project would also contribute to their <a href="http://github.com/ocaml-bytes/ocamlcc">ocamlcc</a> bytecode-to-c compiler).</p><a onclick="switchContent('post2','post1')" class="btn" href="#95a7761a721456bf40e8c3358f475413">Hide</a></div></span>

You can find my manuscript on my <a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~puech/">web page</a>, precisely <a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~puech/thesis.pdf" title="My Ph.D thesis">here</a>; it’s called <em>Certificates for incremental type-checking</em>, and after much hesitation, I chose a blue cover for its printed version (it was a tough choice). It is already a little bit obsolete since I compulsively worked on that material even after its submission to avoid the baby blues, but I will nonetheless advertise it here, and eventually write about my advances in future posts. In short, if you are interested in proof certificates, manipulation of proof objects in a functional language, spine-form LF, incremental type-checking, contextual type theory, or the relationship between natural deduction and the sequent calculus, you might be interested in some parts of my manuscript.</p> <p><span id="more-354"></span></p> <p>In a little more details, the abstract printed on the (blue) back cover reads:</p> <blockquote><p>The central topic of this thesis is the study of algorithms for type checking, both from the programming language and from the proof-theoretic point of view. A type checking algorithm takes a program or a proof, represented as a syntactical object, and checks its validity with respect to a specification or a statement; it is a central piece of compilers and proof assistants. First, we present a tool which supports the development of functional programs manipulating proof certificates (certifying programs). It uses LF as a representation metalanguage for higher-order proofs and OCaml as a programming language, and facilitates the automated and efficient verification of these certificates at run time. Technically, we introduce in particular the notion of function inverse allowing to abstract from a local environment when manipulating open terms. Then, we remark that the idea of a certifying type checker, generating a typing derivation, can be extended to realize an incremental type checker, working by reuse of typing subderivation. Such a type checker would make possible the structured and type-directed edition of proofs and programs. Finally, we showcase an original correspondence between natural deduction and the sequent calculus, through the transformation of the corresponding type checking functional programs: we show, using off-the-shelf program transformations, that the latter is the accumulator-passing version of the former.</p></blockquote> <p>Now that this is over with, I can go back to all the activities I’ve been missing so much these past months (years?); one of them is blogging. So stay tuned for some OCaml fun, serious proof theory and terrible hacks.

This allows a compiler to pick its preferred evaluation strategy. To allow a compiler also to delay side-effects, and to interleave evaluation, the allowed non-determinism is slightly restricted.</p> <p>Let us take a look at the following example.</p> <pre><code>int x = 0; int main() { printf("%d ", (x = 3) + (x = 4)); printf("%d\n", x); return 0; }</code></pre> <p>By considering all possible evaluation paths, one would naively expect this program to print either <code>7 4</code> or <code>7 3</code>, depending on whether <code>x = 3</code> or <code>x = 4</code> is evaluated first. However, the C standard does not allow an object to be modified more than once (or being read after being modified) between two <em>sequence points</em>. A sequence point occurs at the end <code>;</code> of a full expression, before a function call, after the first operand of the conditional <code>? :</code> operator, and in some other situations. Therefore, this program gives rise to a <em>sequence point violation</em> and exhibits <em>undefined behavior</em>. It thus may do literally anything, and indeed, <code>gcc -O1</code> (version <code>4.7.2</code>) prints <code>8 4</code> which does not correspond to one of the evaluation paths.</p> <p>Notice that non-determinism in C is even more unrestrained than some may think. That the evaluation order in <code>e1 + e2</code> is unspecified, does not mean that either <code>e1</code> or <code>e2</code> will be evaluated entirely before the other. Instead, it means that evaluation can be interleaved; first a part of <code>e1</code> could be evaluated, then a part of <code>e2</code>, then another part of <code>e1</code>, ... Hence, the following program is also allowed to print <code>bac</code>.</p> <pre><code>int main() { printf("a") + (printf("b") + printf("c")); return 0; }</code></pre> <h4 id="dealing-with-sequence-point-violations">Dealing with sequence point violations</h4> <p>The executable C semantics by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/c-semantics/">Chucky Ellison and Grigore Rosu</a> provides a nice tool to explore non-deterministic behavior in C and is able to dynamically detect sequence point violations. Since CompCert also has an interpreter, I created an extension of CompCert that allows the interpreter to be used to detect sequence point violations as well.</p> <p>As <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Csem.html">CompCert C</a> already supports non-deterministism in expressions, it was fairly easy to extend Ellison and Rosu's approach to sequence point violations to CompCert. I added a set <code>L</code> of <em>locked</em> locations to CompCert's <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Csem.html#state">execution state</a>. Whenever a write is performed, the address of that write is added to set <code>L</code>. If a read or write to an address contained in <code>L</code> is performed, it results in undefined behavior. At a sequence point, the set <code>L</code> is emptied.</p> <p>Since CompCert picks a reduction strategy in one of its first compilation passes, and my extension removes the sequence point restriction quickly after, it did effect the rest of the compilation passes of CompCert. Since it remains an open (and not easy) question how CompCert could take advantage of sequence point violations to perform more aggressive optimizations, my extension is not part of the official CompCert code.</p> <p>Many tools for verifying C programs also determinize programs in one of their first passes, and let the user verify the determinized program. When solely targeting a specific compiler (for example CompCert) for which the evaluation strategy is known, and which is known not to do any interleaving or delaying of side-effects, this approach works. But to claim something about the correctness of the program when being compiled with another compiler, this approach does not work, even if all possible evaluation paths are considered (see the counter example in <code>gcc</code> above).</p> <p>Some tools will perform syntactical checks to exclude some sequence points violations. But as it is undecidable whether a sequence point violation may occur, determinization, possibly combined with such checks, is either unsound (slides 13 and 15 of <a href="http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/ellison-rosu-2012-popl-slides.pdf">Ellison and Rosu's POPL 2012 talk</a> present some examples in existing tools), or will exclude many valid C programs.</p> <p>To indicate why this is undecidable, consider:</p> <pre><code>int* f() { \\ arbitrary code } int x = 0; int main() { int *p = f(); printf("%d\n", (x = 3) + (*p = 10)); return 0; }</code></pre> <p>Deciding whether a sequence point violation occurs is equivalent to deciding whether <code>f()</code> returns a pointer equal to <code>&amp;x</code>.</p> <p>As I wish to use my <a href="http://robbertkrebbers.nl/research/ch2o">own semantics</a> not only to verify programs compiled by CompCert, having better means of reasoning about programs with non-determinism and sequence points is needed.</p> <h4 id="an-axiomatic-semantics">An axiomatic semantics</h4> <p>As a step towards taking non-determinism and sequence points seriously, I developed an axiomatic semantics for expressions that takes these issues into account. The key idea of my axiomatic semantics is that non-deterministic expression evaluation corresponds to (a weak form) of concurrency. Separation logic is well capable of dealing with concurrency, so my rule for the addition operator is based on the rule for parallel composition.</p> <pre><code>{ Pl } el { Ql } { Pr } er { Qr } -------------------------------------- { Pl * Ql } el + er { Pr * Qr }</code></pre> <p>The idea is that, if the memory can be split up (using the separating conjunction <code>*</code>) into two disjoint parts, in which <code>el</code> respectively <code>er</code> can be evaluated safely, then <code>el + er</code> can be evaluated safely in the whole memory.</p> <p>Obviously, as stated, this rule is too simple for the addition operator. First of all, expressions yield a result, so the post-condition should not just be an assertion, but should also tell something about the result. To that end, we let the post-condition <code>Q</code> be a function from values to assertions. Intuitively, <code>{ P } e { Q }</code> means that if evaluation of <code>e</code> yields a value <code>v</code>, then the assertion <code>Q v</code> should hold afterward.</p> <p>Second of all, we have to take care of undefined behavior by integer overflow. This gives rise to the following revised rule:</p> <pre><code>{ Pl } el { Ql } { Pr } er { Qr } ∀ vl vr, (Ql vl * Qr vr) → (vl + vr ⇓-) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- { Pl * Pr } el + er { λ v', ∃ vl vr, vl + vr ⇓ v' ∧ (Ql vl * Qr vr) }</code></pre> <p>Here, the assertion <code>vl + vr ⇓-</code> ensures that adding <code>vl</code> to <code>vr</code> does not overflow, and the assertion <code>vl + vr ⇓ v'</code> states that <code>v'</code> is the result of adding <code>vl</code> to <code>vr</code>.</p> <p>In order to make this rule sufficiently powerful, a strong version of the separating conjunction <code>*</code> is needed. After all, it should be possible to prove the correctness of programs like <code>x = x + x</code>. Fractional permissions allow memory cells that are solely used for reading to be used in both operands of the separating conjunction <code>*</code>.</p> <p>To take care of sequence point violations, we include a special <em>locked</em> permission. In order to perform a write or a read, one has to prove that the permission of the location to be written to (respectively read from) is not locked. This is captured by the following rule for assignments.</p> <pre><code> Write ⊆ perm_kind γ { Pl } el { Ql } { Pr } er { Qr } ∀ a v, (Ql a * Qr v) → (a ↦{γ} - * R a v) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- { Pl * Pr } el ::= er { λ v, ∃ a, a ↦{lock γ} v * R a v }</code></pre> <p>As standard in separation logic with permissions, the assertion of a singleton memory <code>e1 ↦ e2</code> is extended with its permission <code>γ</code>, resulting in <code>e1 ↦{γ} e2</code>. Hence, this rule requires the permission of the memory cell to be sufficient before the write, and will lock the memory cell after.</p> <p>In the operational semantics, a sequence point results in the set of locked locations being emptied. Xavier Leroy helpfully remarked to me that "a sequence point is just an assignment to the dummy variable of locked locations". This is captured by the following rule.</p> <pre><code>{ P } e { λ v, P' v ▷ } { is_true P' } el { Q } { is_false P' } er { Q } ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- { P } e ? el : er {{ Q }}</code></pre> <p>Here the assertion <code>R ▷</code> empties the set of locked locations, and its semantic interpretation is basically an assignment of the empty set to the set of locked locations.</p> <h4 id="adapting-the-operational-semantics">Adapting the operational semantics</h4> <p>Unfortunately, the way my axiomatic semantics deals with sequence point violations does not correspond well to the operational semantics. In the operational semantics, a sequence point results into the set of locked locations being emptied <em>globally</em>, whereas the axiomatic semantics only talks about a <em>local part</em> of the memory.</p> <p>Hence, I defined another operational semantics that make sequence points local. Instead of unlocking all locations at a sequence point, it only unlocks locations that have been locked in subexpressions of the expression where the sequence point occurred. To achieve this, values <code>val@{Ω} v</code> of the expression syntax are annotated with a set of locked locations <code>Ω</code>. Initially, all values in the program should have the empty set of locked locations. Whenever a write occurs, not only is the written location locked in memory, it is also added to set <code>Ω</code> of the specific subexpression where the write occurred. On a sequence point, just the annotated locations <code>Ω</code> in the specific subexpression where the sequence point occurred are unlocked. Connectives without a sequence point just take the union of the locked locations of their children.</p> <p>For example, my operational semantics contains the following rules</p> <pre><code>ptr@{Ωl} b := val@{Ωr} v, m ⇒ val@{ {[b]} ∪ Ωl ∪ Ωr} v, lock b (&lt;[b:=v]&gt;m) provided that is_writable m b val@{Ω} v ? el : er, m ⇒ er, unlock Ω m provided that value_false v</code></pre> <p>As one can see here, the rule for the assignment not only locks the location <code>b</code>, it also adds it to the locations to be unlocked in the expression. Notice that the predicate <code>is_writable m b</code> also ensures that <code>b</code> is not locked.</p> <p>This way of dealing with sequence points is more restrictive than Ellison/Rosu's approach. For example, my semantics makes</p> <pre><code>int x, y, *p = &amp;y; int f() { if (x) { p = &amp;x; } return 0; } int main() { int r = (x = 1) + (*p = 2) + f(); }</code></pre> <p>undefined. The path that leads to undefined behavior is 1.) <code>x = 1</code> 2.) call <code>f</code> which changes <code>p</code> to <code>&amp;x</code>, 3.) <code>*p = 1</code>. Here, the lock of <code>&amp;x</code> survives the function call. In the semantics of Ellison/Rosu, this program has defined behavior, as the sequence point before the function call destroys all locks, so also the lock of <code>&amp;x</code>.</p> <p>I am still wondering whether my semantics excludes any non artificial programs. Keep in mind that the following program has defined (but non-deterministic) behavior in my operational semantics (as one would expect).</p> <pre><code>int x; int f(int y) { return (x = y); } int main(void) { printf("%d\n", f(3) + f(4)); return 0; }</code></pre> <h4 id="future-work">Future work</h4> <p>Currently I have two versions of an operational semantics for sequence points: one as an extension of CompCert, and a more restrictive version as part of my own development. For the last one I also have an axiomatic semantics (and a formally verified soundness proof).</p> <p>I intend to prove that CompCert is an instance of my semantics in future work. In my <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/bytes-and-pointers-in-compcert/">previous post</a> I described two extensions of CompCert that will be needed for this correspondence.</p> <p>An important next step is to make the axiomatic more suitable to be used for a verification condition generator.</p> <h4 id="sources">Sources</h4> <p>The sources of my extensions to CompCert can be found at my <a href="http://github.com/robbertkrebbers/compcert">github repository</a>, and the sources and documentation of my axiomatic semantics can be found <a href="http://robbertkrebbers.nl/research/ch2o">here</a>.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#ecfd83ba4307c5aba213e1ca667b2244">Hide</a></div></span>

During this stay I have been able to do some CompCert hacking, and to get more experience with CompCert and its semantics.</p> <h4 id="under-specification-in-c">Under-specification in C</h4> <p>Every C compiler has some freedom on how to implement the C programming language as certain constructs are under-specified by the C standard. The standard uses the following notions of under-specification:</p> <ul> <li><em>Unspecified behavior</em>. Constructs for which the standard provides two or more possibilities. For example: order of evaluation in expressions. The behavior may vary for each use of the construct.</li> <li><em>Implementation defined behavior</em>. Similar to unspecified behavior, but the compiler has to document its choice. For example: size of integer types and endianness.</li> <li><em>Undefined behavior</em>. Constructs for which the standard imposes no requirements at all. For example: dereferencing a NULL-pointer and signed integer overflow.</li> </ul> <p>Under-specification is used extensively to make C portable, and to allow compilers to generate faster code. For example, when dereferencing a pointer, no code has to be generated to check whether the pointer is valid. If the pointer is invalid (it is <code>NULL</code> or a dangling pointer), the program may do something arbitrary instead of having to exit with a nice error message.</p> <p>Of course, CompCert also makes use of under-specification. Firstly, it makes specific choices for certain constructs. For example, it chooses a specific representation of integers and uses specific sizes for the various integer types. Secondly, it makes some undefined behavior defined, for example, it lets signed integer overflow wrap around. Remark that for many other constructs, it really imposes undefined behavior. For example, dereferencing an invalid pointer is undefined behavior by the CompCert semantics.</p> <p>To verify properties of programs that are being compiled by CompCert, one can make explicit use of the behaviors that are defined by CompCert but not by the C standard. However, as I wish to use my <a href="http://robbertkrebbers.nl/research/ch2o">own C semantics</a> to verify programs compiled by any C compiler, it should capture the behavior of <em>any</em> C compiler that implements the C standard. Therefore, I have to take <em>all</em> under-specification seriously, whereas CompCert may (and even has to) make specific choices. See for example <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/759">this post</a> by John Regehr for some examples of crazy behavior by actual compilers due to undefined behavior, to get an idea of why taking undefined behavior is necessary.</p> <p>For compilers like <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code>, I will of course not be able to give any formal guarantees that a correctness proof with respect to my semantics actually ensures correctness when compiled. After all, these compilers do not have a formal semantics. I could only argue that my operational semantics makes more things undefined than the C standard, and assuming these compilers "implement the C standard", correctness should morally follow.</p> <p>As a more formal means of validation of my semantics I intend to prove that CompCert is an instance of my semantics in future work. In order for this correspondence to become provable, this post will be about making <em>more behavior defined</em> in CompCert. I will discuss two patches that make previously undefined behaviors in the CompCert semantics defined. These behaviors should be defined according to the C standard. A next post will be about making <em>more behavior undefined</em> (sequence point violations).</p> <h4 id="pointers-in-compcert">Pointers in CompCert</h4> <p>CompCert defines its memory as finite map of blocks, each block consisting of an array of bytes. Pointers are pairs <code>(b,ofs)</code> where <code>b</code> identifies the block, and <code>ofs</code> the offset into that block.</p> <p>The C standard's way of dealing with pointer equality is a bit nasty. Let us take a look at the following excerpt from the C11 standard (6.5.9p5).</p> <blockquote> <p>Two pointers compare equal if and only if [...] or one is a pointer to one past the end of one array object and the other is a pointer to the start of a different array object that happens to immediately follow the first array object in the address space.</p> </blockquote> <p>These pointers <em>one past the end of a block</em> are somewhat strange, as they cannot be dereferenced. Nonetheless, their use is common programming practice when looping through arrays. For example:</p> <pre><code>void map(int *p, int n, int f(int)) { int *end = p + n; while (p &lt; end) { *p = f(*p); p++; } }</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, they can also be abused:</p> <pre><code>int main() { int x, y; if (&amp;x + 1 == &amp;y) printf("x and y are allocated adjacently\n"); }</code></pre> <p>Here, the <code>printf</code> is executed only if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are allocated adjacently, which may actually happen as many compilers allocate <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> consecutively on the stack.</p> <p>In the semantics of CompCert C, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be given disjoint block identifiers, and the pointer representations of <code>&amp;x + 1</code> and <code>&amp;y</code> will thus be unequal. This inequality is not preserved by the compiler, however. During <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Cminorgen.html">stack allocation</a>, the blocks of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be combined, and the representation of <code>&amp;x + 1</code> may become equal to <code>&amp;y</code>. Hence, to ensure that pointer comparisons are preserved under compilation, CompCert used to make comparison of two pointers defined if and only if both are <em>valid</em>. Here, a pointer is valid if its offset is strictly within the block bounds.</p> <p>In my patch for CompCert, this restriction is slightly weakened.</p> <ul> <li>Comparison of two pointers in the same block is defined if and only if both are <em>weakly valid</em>. A pointer is weakly valid if it is valid, or "one past the end of" its block.</li> <li>Comparison of two pointers with different blocks is defined if and only if both are valid.</li> </ul> <p>This modification allows common programming practice when looping through arrays, but <em>weird</em> comparisons, as the one in the example above, remain undefined. This is necessary to ensure that pointer comparisons are preserved under compilation. I therefore think the above definition of pointer comparisons is more sensible than the one in the C standard (notice that the C standard already makes a distinction between pointers in the same block and pointers in different blocks, for pointer inequalities <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>.)</p> <p>To adapt the compiler correctness proofs I had to show that all compilation passes preserve weak validity of pointers and preserve the new definition of pointer comparisons. To make this happen, I had to modify the definition of <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Memory.html#Mem.inject">memory injections</a> accordingly.</p> <h4 id="bytes-in-compcert">Bytes in CompCert</h4> <p>Whereas CompCert uses sequences of bits to represent bytes constituting integer or floating point values, bytes constituting fragments of pointers are treated symbolically. These <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Memdata.html#memval">bytes</a> are of the shape "fragment <code>i</code> of pointer <code>(b,ofs)</code>". So, when storing a pointer <code>(b,ofs)</code> in memory, 4 bytes "fragment <code>0</code> of pointer <code>(b,ofs)</code>", ..., "fragment <code>3</code> of pointer <code>(b,ofs)</code>" are written.</p> <p>Beforehand, it was only possible to read a sequence of such bytes as a pointer value, whereas single pointer fragments could not be read as a value of type <code>unsigned char</code>. Trying to do so resulted in undefined behavior. As a result, it was impossible to implement a used-defined version of <code>memcpy</code> in CompCert C that works for data structures containing pointers.</p> <p>I created an extension that gives a semantics to byte-wise reading and writing of pointer fragments. This is achieved by extending the data type of values with an additional construct <code>Vptrseg</code> for a pointer fragments.</p> <pre><code>Inductive val: Type := | Vundef: val | Vint: int -&gt; val | Vfloat: float -&gt; val | Vptr: block -&gt; int -&gt; val | Vptrseg: block -&gt; int -&gt; nat -&gt; val.</code></pre> <p>The tricky part is how to deal with arithmetical operations and casts on pointer fragment values. In my patch I made all arithmetical operations (addition, shifts, ...) on pointer fragments undefined.</p> <p>Casts are slightly more involved as they are implicitly performed before an assignment. Hence, to enable writing of pointer fragments, casts from character type to character type should be made defined on pointer fragments. Since CompCert C is untyped, there is no guarantee that the result of the operand of a cast from type <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> is indeed a valid value of <code>A</code>. However, as the compiler needs to know that the result of such a cast is indeed a valid value of <code>B</code>, casts from character to character type really have to do something. Previously, it always performed a zero or sign extension.</p> <p>For the case of pointer fragments, no definition of zero and sign extension can be given (with reasonable properties). Hence, in order to overcome this problem, the semantics of a cast in my patch checks whether the operand of a character to character cast is indeed an allowed value. If not, it results in undefined behavior. This has the desired result that character to character casts before assignments can be removed in a later compilation phase and byte-wise reading and writing of pointer fragments is made possible.</p> <p>If CompCert C would get a type system in future versions that ensures that the result of an operand of a cast is indeed a valid value of the given type, this trick can be removed.</p> <h4 id="example">Example</h4> <p>Now that these two behaviors are defined, my extension of CompCert gives a semantics to the following implementation of <code>memcpy</code>.</p> <pre><code>void my_memcpy (void *p, void *q, int n) { // r may be one past unsigned char *r = (unsigned char*)p + n; while (p &lt; r) { *((unsigned char*)p++) = *((unsigned char*)q++); } } int main() { struct S { short x; short *p; } s = { 10, &amp;s.x }, s2; my_memcpy (&amp;s2, &amp;s, sizeof(struct S)); return *s2.p; }</code></pre> <h4 id="sources">Sources</h4> <p>The recently released CompCert 1.13 contains my patch for pointers one past the end of a block.

When you first install mysql on Debian Squeeze, the root password is not set. That's bad. Let set it using sekred and puppet.</p> <pre>node "mysqlserver" { package { ["mysql-server", "mysql-client", "sekred"]: ensure =&gt; installed; } service { "mysqld": name =&gt; "mysql", ensure =&gt; running, hasrestart =&gt; true, hasstatus =&gt; true; } exec { "mysql-set-root-password": command =&gt; "mysqladmin -u root password $(sekred get root@mysql)", onlyif =&gt; "mysql -u root", # Trigger only if password-less root account. require =&gt; [Service["mysqld"], Package["mysql-client", "sekred"]]; } } </pre> <p>And to get the root password for mysql, just login into the node "mysqlserver":</p> <pre>$&gt; sekred get root@mysql Cie8ieza </pre> <h2>Setting password for SSH-only user</h2> <p>This example is quite typical of the broken fully automated scenario with passwords: - you setup a remote host only accessible through SSH - you create a user and set its SSH public key to authorize access - your user <strong>cannot</strong> access its account because SSH prevent password-less account login!</p> <p>In other word, you need to login into the node, set a password for the user and mail him back.... That defeats a little bit the "automation" provided by puppet.</p> <p>Here is what I do with sekred:</p> <pre>define user::template () { user { $name: ensure =&gt; present, membership =&gt; minimum, shell =&gt; "/bin/bash", .... } include "ssh_keys::$name" # Check password less account and set one, if required. $user_passwd="$(sekred get --uid $name $name@login)" exec { "user-set-default-password-$name": command =&gt; "echo $name:$user_passwd | chpasswd", onlyif =&gt; "test \"$(getent shadow $name | cut -f2 -d:)\" = \"!\"", require =&gt; [User[$name], Package["sekred"]]; } } </pre> <p>So the command <em>"test \"$(getent shadow $name | cut -f2 -d:)\" = \"!\""</em> test for a password-less account. If this is the case, it creates a password using <em>sekred get --uid $name $name@login</em> and set it through <em>chpasswd</em>.</p> <p>Note that <em>$user_passwd</em> use a shell expansion that will be evaluated when running the command only, on the host. The <em>--uid</em> flag of sekred assign the ownership of the password to the given user id.</p> <p>So now the user (foo) can login into the node and retrieve its password using <em>sekred get foo@login</em>.</p> <h2>Try it!</h2> <p>Sekred was a very short project but I am pretty happy with it. It solves a long standing problem and helps to cover an extra mile of automation when setting up new nodes.</p> <p>The homepage is <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/sekred/" title="here">here</a> and you can download it <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/?group_id=331" title="here">here</a>.
