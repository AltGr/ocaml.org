I think it's a good opportunity to see an implementation of a (very simple) typestate, and also some funny tricks with Mezzo's permissions.</p> <p>A word of warning, though: while the theory and implementation of Mezzo are starting to fit in nicely, the library-land is very much unknown territory so far. We are trying new things, and expect them to be easier in the future. As always, practice and teaching will surely yield substantial improvements, leading us to see in retrospect how we could have simplified things. Expect the code examples in this post to look <em>complicated</em>, and probably not representative of the Mezzo code we expect to write in the future.</p> <h3 id="briefing">Briefing</h3> <p>What I want as an iterator is an object that let us iterate on a collection, giving one new element each time we call a function <code>next</code>, that makes the iterator go a step forward. Note that such an iterator is mutable, its internal state being modified by <code>next</code>. It would be possible to consider functional iterators, returning a value corresponding to the next position in the list; but to study the relation with typestate systems we decide to study <em>mutable</em> iterators here.</p> <p>We have to handle the case where the iterator has no more elements. In Java or Scala, you have to check if there are more elements available with <code>hasNext</code>, and if you call <code>next</code> on an empty iterator, an exception is raised. In Mezzo we don't have exceptions. Moreover, we want to statically express the protocol that the operations on an iterator must follow, in the types themselves. It's the idea of typestate. By achieving that, the user is prevented <em>at compilation time</em> of using <code>next</code> on an empty iterator.</p> <p>The application to (simply linked) lists seems straightforward: you just have to follow the <code>tail</code> link of each <code>Cons</code> cell, starting with the head of the list. What is not so trivial is how to express that with Mezzo's permissions.</p> <h3 id="the-silent-iterator">The silent iterator</h3> <p>Let's start with a very stupid iterator: it traverses the list, but without giving its elements to the user.</p> <h4 id="from-the-outside-signatures">From the outside: signatures</h4> <h5 id="an-iterator-has-exclusive-access-on-the-list">An iterator has exclusive access on the list</h5> <p>First, to be able to iterate on a list, the iterator will need the permission to access the list and its contents. A solution is to <strong>consume</strong> the permission <code>l @ list a</code> when you create an iterator on the list <code>l</code> (of elements of type <code>a</code>), and <strong>give it back</strong> when the iteration is finished (or when you stop the iterator manually).</p> <p>This gives us the following signatures for the <code>new</code> and <code>stop</code> functions:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> <span class="kw">new</span>: [a] (consumes l: <span class="dt">list</span> a) -&gt; iterator a (l @ <span class="dt">list</span> a) <span class="kw">val</span> stop: [a, post: perm] (consumes iterator a post) -&gt; (| post)</code></pre> <p>In case you're not familiar with Mezzo syntax yet, you can find more details in <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/introduction-to-mezzo/">the first post</a> cited above, but let me just do a quick reminder here. The bracket notation <code>[post:perm]</code> is parametric polymorphism on a type of kind <code>perm</code> (a permission), and that <code>(consumes foo)</code> indicates that type <code>foo</code> is not given back to the type environment after the functional call. Finally, <code>(foo | bar)</code> is a conjunction of the type <code>foo</code> and the permission <code>bar</code>, which may be a purely static information, not associated to any runtime value; in particular, <code>(| post)</code> is an empty tuple that is only useful as the carrier of the permission <code>post</code>.</p> <h5 id="expressing-iterator-typestate">Expressing iterator typestate</h5> <p>We also need a <code>next</code> function, that takes an iterator in input. To handle the fact that <code>next</code> may lead to an empty iterator, we say that <code>next</code> consumes the fact that the input argument is an iterator, and returns a variant of <code>option a</code>:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">data offer (post: perm) a = | <span class="dt">None</span> {| post } | <span class="dt">Some</span> { x: a }</code></pre> <p>In the first case, the iteration is finished: the <code>post</code> permission (in practice equal to <code>l @ list a</code> for a given <code>a</code> and <code>l</code>) is returned. In the second case, an element is returned. Note that we could have used the sum type of the standard library, <code>choice a b</code>, but this specific datatype allows us to give more explicit constructor names (than <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>).</p> <p>We now have the <code>next</code> signature:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> next: [a, post: perm] (consumes it: iterator a post) -&gt; offer post (| it @ iterator a post)</code></pre> <p>For now, because our iterator is silent, in the <code>Some</code> case, we return no value of type <code>a</code>, only the fact that <code>it</code> is still an iterator, so we can continue the iteration. On the contrary, after a <code>None</code> answer, it is statically not possible to call <code>next</code> again: the permission <code>it @ iterator a post</code> has been consumed and was not returned through the offer.</p> <div class="figure"> <img src="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/ts1.png" alt="Typestate of the iterator"/><p class="caption">Typestate of the iterator</p> </div> <p>A small code example using this iterator:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="co">(* Loop calls [next] on the iterator until it is empty *)</span> <span class="kw">val</span> <span class="kw">rec</span> loop [a, post: perm] (consumes it: iterator a post): (| post) = <span class="kw">match</span> next it <span class="kw">with</span> | <span class="dt">None</span> -&gt; () | <span class="dt">Some</span> { x } -&gt; loop it end</code></pre> <h4 id="diving-into-the-internals-implementation">Diving into the internals: implementation</h4> <h5 id="a-first-attempt">A first attempt</h5> <p>To be able to go forward, the iterator must store the elements that will be explored in the future. With a list, it's easy: initially, it consists in the list itself, and each call to <code>next</code> just takes the tail of the current internal list.</p> <p>This gives us:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">data <span class="kw">mutable</span> iterator a (post: perm) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { xs: <span class="dt">list</span> a } data offer (post: perm) a = | <span class="dt">None</span> { | post } | <span class="dt">Some</span> { x: a } <span class="kw">val</span> <span class="kw">new</span> [a] (consumes l: <span class="dt">list</span> a): iterator a (l @ <span class="dt">list</span> a) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { xs = l } <span class="kw">val</span> next [a, post: perm] (consumes it: iterator a post): offer post (| it @ iterator a post) = <span class="kw">match</span> it.xs <span class="kw">with</span> | <span class="dt">Nil</span> -&gt; <span class="dt">None</span> | <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head; tail } -&gt; it.xs &lt;- tail; <span class="dt">Some</span> { x = () } end</code></pre> <p>Sadly, this example doesn't typecheck: in the match case where <code>it.xs</code> is <code>Nil</code>, we return <code>None</code>, and the permission <code>post</code>. However, we don't have <code>post</code>!</p> <p>Formally, at the beginning of <code>next</code>, the only available permissions are <code>it @ iterator a post</code>, and in the first match case, <code>it.xs @ Nil</code>. Nothing here gives us <code>post</code>.<br/>Intuitively, even if we had <code>post</code> at the beginning, <code>next</code> here doesn't preserves the knowledge of the cons cells we have already explored: we have to store in the iterator the permissions of the previous cons cells, to be able to finally merge them back into <code>post</code>.</p> <h5 id="storing-the-old-permissions">Storing the old permissions</h5> <p>We introduce a new permission, <code>p</code>, that describes the permission for the consumed cons cells. The iterator contains <code>p</code>, and a function, <code>rewind</code>, that consumes <code>p</code>, and the permission on the tail, and merge them into <code>post</code>.</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">data <span class="kw">mutable</span> iterator a (p: perm) (post: perm) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { content: ( xs: <span class="dt">list</span> a, rewind: (| consumes (p * xs @ <span class="dt">list</span> a)) -&gt; (| post) | p ) }</code></pre> <p>With this definition of <code>iterator</code>, the signature of <code>next</code> would be:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> next: [a, p: perm, post: perm] ( consumes it: <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { content: ( xs: <span class="dt">list</span> a, rewind: (| consumes (p * xs @ <span class="dt">list</span> a)) -&gt; (| post) | p ) } -&gt; offer post (| it @ iterator a (p * xs @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head: a; tail: unknown }) post)</code></pre> <p>The idea is that before the call to <code>next</code>, the iterator stores in <code>xs</code> the permission on the non-traversed part of the list, <code>xs</code>, and <code>rewind</code> requests the permission on the already-traversed part of the list, represented by <code>p</code>, upto <code>xs</code> excluded. If <code>xs</code> is itself a cons cell (and only in this case), we can call <code>next</code>; the iterator will then store only the tail of <code>xs</code>, and its rewind function request the permission for <code>p</code>, plus the first cell of <code>xs</code> -- which at this point as been traversed.</p> <p>Concretely, imagine we have the following list construction, for some list <code>lb @ list int</code>.</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> la = <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head=1; tail=lb }</code></pre> <p>and are now iterating on this list. Assuming we have already called <code>next</code> once, have traversed the first cell of <code>la</code>, the <code>rewind</code> function of the iterator would have a type equivalent to the following:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">rewind: (| consumes ( la @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head:int; tail=lb } * lb @ <span class="dt">list</span> <span class="dt">int</span>) ) -&gt; (| post )</code></pre> <p>If we pattern-match on <code>lb</code>, in the <code>Cons</code> case, the typing environment will learn that <code>lb</code> has type <code>Cons { head : int; tail = lc }</code> for some tail <code>lc @ list int</code>. So rewind has the refined type</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">rewind: (| consumes ( la @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head:int; tail=lb } * lb @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head:int; tail=lc }) ) -&gt; (| post )</code></pre> <p>The already-traversed part of the list, <code>la</code>, has the same type, but the not-yet-traversed part has been refined to a cons type. Note that with the additional hypothesis <code>lc @ int</code> of our context, this is equivalent to the following type:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">rewind: (| consumes ( (la @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head:int; tail=lb } * lb @ <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head:int; tail=lc }) * lc @ <span class="dt">list</span> <span class="dt">int</span> ) -&gt; (| post )</code></pre> <p>which is precisely the type of the <code>rewind</code> function of the iterator <em>returned</em> by <code>next</code>. So after pattern-matching, the type of the <code>rewind</code> function passed to <code>next</code> becomes exactly the same as the type of the <code>rewind</code> function expected as a return value. We can return this function, unchanged: it has just been <em>transtyped</em>.</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> next it <span class="co">(* lengthy type annotation that we won't repeat here *)</span> = <span class="kw">let</span> (xs, rewind) = it.content <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="kw">match</span> xs <span class="kw">with</span> | <span class="dt">Nil</span> -&gt; <span class="co">(* p * xs @ list a *)</span> rewind (); <span class="co">(* post *)</span> <span class="dt">None</span> | <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head; tail } -&gt; it.content &lt;- (tail, rewind); <span class="dt">Some</span> end</code></pre> <p>As we described, in the <code>Cons</code> case, the value of the <code>xs</code> field of <code>it</code> is changed to <code>tail</code>, but the <code>rewind</code> field is unchanged.</p> <p>Remark: we can still shorten this definition by quantifying <code>p</code> existentially in the definition of <code>iterator</code>, and the typechecker will be able to pack and unpack the quantification to do implicitly what we've done explicitly previously (the conversion <code>p</code> → <code>p * xs @ Cons { head: a; tail: unknown }</code>).</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">data <span class="kw">mutable</span> iterator a (post: perm) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { content: { p: perm } ( xs: <span class="dt">list</span> a, rewind: (| consumes (p * xs @ <span class="dt">list</span> a)) -&gt; (| post) | p ) }</code></pre> <p>The type for <code>next</code> becomes much more readable.

But it would be even more great if we could actually get the contents of the list!</p> <p>This is a bit more complicated: while giving an element to the user, we have to give him also the permission on it. This breaks the invariant "the iterator always can have <code>post</code> by applying <code>rewind</code>". Now, our iterator can have a <em>hole</em> in it: when giving an element to the user, a hole appears. To continue the iteration, the user <em>must</em> give the permission on the element back to the iterator.</p> <p>Consequently, the definition of <code>iterator</code> changes a bit: an <code>iterator</code> is now also parametrized by a permission <code>hole</code>, which in fact means "what does the iterator need to fill its hole and be able to generate <code>post</code>".</p> <p>Here is the new definition of <code>iterator</code>. Note that it doesn't contains <code>hole</code>, but we need it to generate <code>post</code>:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml">data <span class="kw">mutable</span> iterator a (hole: perm) (post: perm) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { content: { p: perm } ( xs: <span class="dt">list</span> a, rewind: (| p * hole * l @ <span class="dt">list</span> a) -&gt; (| post) | p ) }</code></pre> <p>Thus, an iterator without a hole is an <code>iterator a empty post</code>, while an iterator that has given away <code>x @ a</code> to the user is a <code>iterator a (x @ a) post</code>.</p> <p>We can now write <code>next</code>. It takes an iterator parametrized by any permission <code>hole</code>, the permission <code>hole</code> itself, and implicitly fills the hole by merging <code>hole</code> into <code>p</code>. It finally returns the next element (if any).</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> next [a, hole: perm, post: perm] (consumes (it: iterator a hole post | hole)): offer post (x: a | it @ iterator a (x @ a) post) = <span class="kw">let</span> xs, rewind = it.content <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="kw">match</span> xs <span class="kw">with</span> | <span class="dt">Nil</span> -&gt; rewind (); <span class="dt">None</span> | <span class="dt">Cons</span> { head; tail } -&gt; s.content &lt;- tail, rewind <span class="dt">Some</span> { x = head } end</code></pre> <p>And we can now use this iterator:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="co">(* [nth] takes an iterator [it] and an integer [n], makes him go forward of [n]</span> <span class="co"> steps, and then returns it (if it hasn't been consumed) *)</span> <span class="kw">val</span> <span class="kw">rec</span> nth [a, hole: perm, post: perm] (consumes (it: iterator a hole post | hole), n: <span class="dt">int</span>): offer (x: a | it @ iterator a (x @ a) post) post = <span class="kw">match</span> next [hole = hole] it <span class="kw">with</span> | <span class="dt">None</span> -&gt; <span class="dt">None</span> | <span class="dt">Some</span> { x } -&gt; <span class="kw">if</span> n &lt;= 0 <span class="kw">then</span> ( <span class="dt">Some</span> { x = x } ) <span class="kw">else</span> ( nth [a = a, hole = (x @ a)] (it, n<span class="dv">-1</span>) ) end </code></pre> <p>You can note that we have sometimes to instantiate by hand the polymorphic parameters when calling a function. For example, here, when calling recursively <code>nth</code>, we have to say that a previous call to <code>next</code> has created a hole of "shape" <code>x @ a</code> we want to merge back to continue the iteration.</p> <h3 id="the-cherry-on-top">The cherry on top</h3> <p>So, here it is, an iterator on lists!<br/>However, this needs a little cleaning: we store in our iterator a rewind function, which is the same for every iterator, that doesn't change over time, and is just present to <em>convert</em> permissions.</p> <p>A way to clean up a bit is to declare a toplevel identity function, named <code>convert</code>:</p> <pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span class="kw">val</span> convert (): () = () alias convertible (p: perm) (q: perm): perm = convert @ (| consumes p) -&gt; (| q) data <span class="kw">mutable</span> iterator a (hole: perm) (post: perm) = <span class="dt">Iterator</span> { content: {p: perm} ( l: <span class="dt">list</span> a | p * convertible (p * hole * l @ <span class="dt">list</span> a) post ) }</code></pre> <p>I find that piece of code cute, and I think it enlightens the way the transtyping of <code>rewind</code> works: if rewind can have type <code>(| consumes p) -&gt; (| q)</code> it's because this is a subtype of <code>() -&gt; ()</code>, which means we have convinced the typechecker that <code>p</code> is convertible into <code>q</code>.</p> <h3 id="i-want-the-code">I want the code!</h3> <p>I doubt so, but just in case, the complete code, with some dummy examples of applications, <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/listiterator.mz.src.html">can be found there</a>.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post4','post3')" class="btn" href="#15aa8b6782b0ab6fe5b10e3acb7c6035">Hide</a></div></span>

Based on a long experience of teaching OCaml, based on the analysis of a large database of failing-to-compile OCaml source code, and based on the recent arguments put forward for justifying the use of Python instead of OCaml for teaching programming, we argue that it would be possible, with relatively little effort, to make OCaml significantly more accessible to beginners. More precisely, we describe parsing tools, minor syntax extensions, type-checking tools and libraries that, altogether, should make OCaml much easier to learn.</p> <h3 id="problems">Problems</h3> <p>We have observed that OCaml is really hard for beginners to learn without help. The main cause is the terribly poor reporting of static and dynamic errors. We describe a few striking examples below.</p> <ul> <li><p>Syntax errors are often reported near the end of a top-level definition although the error is actually located in the middle of the definition. This situation occurs in particular when replacing a <code>in</code> keyword with a semicolon, a very frequent mistake.</p></li> <li><p>The instruction contained in the <code>then</code> branch of a conditional cannot be followed by a semicolon, contrary to the instruction in the <code>else</code> branch (and to instructions in regular sequences). The logic of semicolon being a separator and not a terminator is totally incomprehensible for beginners.</p></li> <li><p>Very early in their OCaml programming experience, beginners face type errors of the form "foo has type <code>int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code> whereas it is expected to be of type <code>int</code>", as a consequence of typos or missing parentheses. The problem is that they encounter this kind of error messages at a point where they do not know anything about arrow types or even about functions.</p></li> <li><p>Exceptions such as "array index out of bounds" are reported without a mention of the index involved, nor of the size of the array, nor of the line at which the incorrect array access has been performed. This lack of details slows down debugging. (Using a full-featured debugger is often not an option at this stage.)</p></li> </ul> <p>Besides our in-situ teaching experience, we have been teaching OCaml through a (French-speaking) website that features online evaluation of exercises (<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/www.france-ioi.org">www.france-ioi.org</a>).</p> <p>Our analysis of submitted programs confirms that the kind of issues reported above are extremely frequent and very time-consuming for beginners to solve on their own. We observed that a significant number of beginners ended up giving up the OCaml tutorial, especially when they were not in a position to obtain help from a nearby OCaml guru.</p> <p>In addition to the issues described above, which are well-known to everyone who has taught programming using OCaml, we can also learn about the limitations of OCaml from teachers who have introduced their students to programming using other languages. In particular, we have observed a recent and significant trend to use Python as a first programming language. When told about the Python trend, OCaml experts usually express their disappointment through a sentence of the kind: "What!? Python?! But it does not even have static types! Not to mention that variable scoping is broken!". Despite the wiseness captured by this comment, a number of qualified teachers and researchers have put forwards a collection of arguments to justify the choice of Python over OCaml.</p> <ul> <li><p>Python provides a simple way to execute a program (<code>python source.py</code>), avoiding the need to first compile the program and then execute it. OCaml supports a somewhat similar feature (<code>ocaml source.ml</code>), however this feature is not advertised and, even worse, it executes top-level definitions one by one before type-checking the entire source file.</p></li> <li><p>Python, unlike OCaml, features a generic printing function, which is very handy for debugging. Similarly, Python features a very-simple-to-use function that one can call to print a backtrace.</p></li> <li><p>Python avoids the awkward floating point operators such as <code>(+.)</code> instead of <code>(+)</code>, which is the conventional mathematical notation and is used by nearly all other programming languages.</p></li> <li><p>Python has a traditional treatment of variables that are mutable by default, avoiding beginners to be confused as to when to use an <code>int</code> or an <code>int ref</code>, and to face unclear type error messages when forgetting the <code>(!)</code> operator.</p></li> <li><p>Python features unbounded integers, which saves the need to introduce beginners very early (too early) in the programming course to the notion of fixed-size representation and overflows.</p></li> <li><p>Python offers simple-to-use implementations of maps, whereas in OCaml, obtaining a structure more efficient than lists requires a "black-magic" instantiation of the Map functor.</p></li> <li><p>Python has excellent and numerous bindings to plotting and mathematical libraries. These libraries are particularly useful for teaching "programming for scientists" courses. However, there is no equivalent in OCaml, and it currently involves a lot of hard work to develop bindings for Python libraries.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="proposals">Proposals</h3> <p>There are a number of things that we can do to make life significantly easier for OCaml beginners — and for OCaml teachers.</p> <h4 id="syntax-of-semicolons">Syntax of semicolons</h4> <p>In OCaml, instructions (expressions of type <code>unit</code>) can usually be terminated by an optional semicolon. For example, a semicolon is accepted in front of the <code>end</code> keyword, in front of the <code>done</code> keyword, in front of the vertical bar separator (<code>|</code>) in pattern matching... but is rejected in front of the <code>else</code> keyword! This lack of consistence in the language is particularly problematic because it forces one to explain very early in an OCaml course that the semicolon is not a <em>terminator</em> but a <em>separator</em> for expressions. Moreover, it makes is hard for beginners to rearrange the lines of a program. We suggest that the semicolon should be accepted in front of the <code>else</code> keyword. This change should not introduce any backward compatibility issue, since we are only relaxing the syntax.</p> <h4 id="syntax-of-reference-updates">Syntax of reference updates</h4> <p>To increment the content of a reference <code>r</code>, one can write <code>r.contents &lt;- r.contents + 1</code>. This formulation makes perfect sense: <code>r</code> denotes the name of a box (the reference), <code>r.contents</code> denotes the contents of this box, and <code>r.contents &lt;- v</code> is the syntax to update the contents. Because writing <code>.contents</code> all the time is very cumbersome, we introduce the OCaml notation <code>!r</code> as a shorthand for <code>r.contents</code>. However, beginners then expect to be able to write <code>!r &lt;- !r + 1</code>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the operator <code>(!)</code> is defined as a function and not as a primitive construction for <code>.contents</code>. So, we have to teach the form <code>r := !r + 1</code>, which appears to be very confusing for students, who tend to write either <code>!r := !r + 1</code> or <code>r := r + 1</code>, but never the right form. The reason is that they —rightfully— expect to refer to the content of the reference on both sides of the affectation operator.</p> <p>There is a simple way to address this problem: extend the syntax in order to parse <code>!r &lt;- v</code> as a primitive construction. This would be no more ad-hoc than the current parsing of <code>t.(i) &lt;- v</code>, and would allow teachers to simply say that <code>&lt;-</code> is the affectation operator both for references and for arrays, and that <code>!r</code> is the way to refer to the contents of a box. Beginners would be able to write the symmetric form <code>!r &lt;- !r + 1</code>, until they become ready to appreciate the more elaborated forms <code>r := !r + 1</code> and <code>incr r</code>.</p> <p>Remark: the ambiguous form <code>!t.(i) &lt;- v</code> should be resolved as <code>(!t).(i) &lt;- v</code>, to be consistent with the parsing of <code>!t.(i)</code>.</p> <h4 id="the-pre-parser">The pre-parser</h4> <p>The purpose of the pre-parser is to reject any program that is not reasonably indented, thereby anticipating on potentially complicated syntax and type errors that the OCaml compiler would report. Moreover, it would impose good coding style to students, a "feature" valued by many teachers using Python. Note that the pre-parser is not enforcing very strict rules about the indentation (unlike an automatic-indentation tool would do). Instead, it is designed to accept all reasonable OCaml styles.</p> <p>For example, the pre-parser would impose the body of loops, of function bodies, and of cases of pattern matching to be consistently indented. For let bindings, it would impose</p> <ol style=""> <li>that a <code>let</code> be at the beginning of a line where it appears,</li> <li>that a <code>in</code> be the last word of the line where it appears,</li> <li>that, if the body of a <code>let</code> spans over more than one line, then there is a line return immediately after the <code>=</code> sign.</li> </ol> <p>Moreover, to detect missing parentheses in arithmetic expressions, the pre-parser would impose infix arithmetic operators to be surrounded by the same number of spaces on each side (e.g. <code>x-1</code> and <code>x - 1</code> are accepted, but not <code>x -1</code>).</p> <h4 id="the-pre-typechecker">The pre-typechecker</h4> <p>The pre-typechecker is able to typecheck code written in the core fragment of OCaml (the fragment used for teaching to beginners). Its purpose is to report easier-to-understand error messages. One key ingredient is the error message associated with function applications. If a call of the form <code>f x y</code> fails to typecheck, the tool would report a message of the form "the application does not type-check because <code>f</code> has type <code>'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int</code> and <code>x</code> has type <code>int</code> and <code>y has type float</code>". Note that the pre-typechecker does not need to be as efficient as the real OCaml type-checker, so we can easily keep track of additional information (e.g. all unifications pairs) that may be useful to reporting conflicts.</p> <h4 id="the-easy-library">The Easy library</h4> <p>We propose a module called <code>Easy</code> to be added to the standard library in order to provide beginners with several useful functions.</p> <ol style=""> <li><p>A function <code>print</code> of type <code>'a -&gt; unit</code>, that recurses in data structures except functions and cyclic structures, limiting the depth in order to avoid overflow of the standard output.</p></li> <li><p>A function <code>backtrace</code> of type <code>unit -&gt; unit</code>, that prints an easy-to-read backtrace.</p></li> <li><p>Polymorphic arithmetic operators <code>(+)</code>, <code>(-)</code>, <code>(*)</code> and <code>(/)</code> of type <code>'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a</code>, and unary negation of type <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>. For types others than <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>, an error could either be produced at runtime (requires representation of types at runtime), or an error could be produced by the (pre-)type-checker if it sees that the polymorphic type was not instantiated with a numeric type (this would preclude polymorphic definitions such as <code>let sq x = x * x</code>);</p></li> <li><p>Pre-instantiated versions of the <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code> functors using the built-in comparison operator. For example <code>Set.add</code> would be exported as a function of type <code>'a -&gt; 'a Set.t -&gt; 'a Set.t</code>.</p></li> </ol> <h4 id="the--bigint-flag">The -bigint flag</h4> <p>We propose to extend <code>ocamlc</code> and <code>ocamlopt</code> with a flag called <code>-bigint</code>, whose purpose is to replace fixed-size integers with arbitrary-precision integers in the compilation chain. This feature would avoid the need for premature discussions about overflows. (Besides, it would be very useful in the context of producing mechanically-verified software.) Implementing the <code>-bigint</code> flag requires only minor modifications to the compiler for 64-bit architectures. For string and array accesses, we need to check a single bit to make sure that the index provided indeed is an acceptable index. For indices of for-loops, we need to generate slightly different code for the manipulation of the loop index.</p> <h4 id="the--easy-flag">The -easy flag</h4> <p>We propose the introduction of an option <code>-easy</code> to the tools <code>ocamlc</code> and <code>ocamlopt</code>. The purpose of this flag is to:</p> <ol style=""> <li>run the pre-parser,</li> <li>run the pre-typechecker,</li> <li>automatically open the <code>Easy</code> library,</li> <li>activate the <code>-bigint</code> compilation flag,</li> <li>ensure that the compiled program reports locations, index and size parameters on out-of-bounds errors.</li> </ol> <h4 id="the-ocamleasy-tool">The ocamleasy tool</h4> <p>We propose the introduction of a tool called <code>ocamleasy</code> whose purpose is to</p> <ol style=""> <li><p>run of <code>ocamldep</code> and the automatic inclusion of all the dependencies and libraries that are required by the source file provided,</p></li> <li><p>compile the program using either <code>ocamlc -easy</code>, or <code>ocamlopt -easy</code>, depending on whether the option <code>-opt</code> is provided to {ocamleasy},</p></li> <li><p>execute the program.</p></li> </ol> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Many of the proposals can be implemented in just a few hours of work. Others require a several days of work, but this investment will certainly be negligible compared with the amount of time saved by people learning OCaml. We encourage people teaching using OCaml to give feedback on the proposals and complete the list with their own suggestions. We encourage the OCaml experts to report any incompatibility they can think of between the "easy" mode proposed and the advanced features of the language. Finally, we encourage the OCaml developers to help us implement and release the proposals, so that they become available to the world before people give up completely on the idea of using OCaml for teaching programming languages.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#cd0e580577c7fb67e6d4b8833cebf547">Hide</a></div></span>

This is quite amazing, since mathematicians do not normally work together in large groups. In a small group they can get away with using obsolete technology, such as sending each other source LaTeX files by email, but with two dozen people even Dropbox or any other file synchronization system would have failed miserably. Luckily, many of us are computer scientists disguised as mathematicians, so we knew how to tackle the logistics. We used <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. In the beginning it took some convincing and getting used to, although it was not too bad. In the end the repository served not only as an archive for our files, but also as a central hub for planning and discussions. For several months I checked github more often than email and Facbook. Github <em>was</em> my Facebook (without the cute kittens). If you do not know about tools like git but you write scientific papers (or you create any kind of digital content) you really, really should learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control</a> systems. Even as a sole author of a paper you will profit from learning how to use one, not to mention that you can make <a href="https://vimeo.com/68761218">pretty videos</a> of how you wrote your paper.</p> <p>But more importantly, the spirit of collaboration that pervaded our group at the <a href="http://www.ias.edu/">Institute for Advanced Study</a> was truly amazing. We did not fragment. We talked, shared ideas, <a href="http://video.ias.edu/taxonomy/term/78">explained things</a> to each other, and completely forgot who did what (so much in fact that we had to put some effort into reconstruction of history lest it be forgotten forever). The result was a substantial increase in productivity. There is a lesson to be learned here (other than the fact that the Institute for Advanced Study is the world’s premier research institution), namely that mathematicians benefit from being a little less possessive about their ideas and results. I know, I know, academic careers depend on proper credit being given and so on, but really those are just the idiosyncrasies of our time. If we can get mathematicians to share half-baked ideas, not to worry who contributed what to a paper, or even who the authors are, then we will reach a new and unimagined level of productivity. Progress is made by those who dear the break rules.</p> <p>Truly open research habitats cannot be obstructed by copyright, profit-grabbing publishers, patents, commercial secrets, and funding schemes that are based on faulty achievement metrics. Unfortunately we are all caught up in a system which suffers from all of these evils. But we made a small step in the right direction by making the <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book">book source code freely available</a> under a permissive Creative Commons license. Anyone can take the book and modify it, send us improvements and corrections, translate it, or even sell it without giving us any money. (If you twitched a little bit when you read that sentence then the system has gotten to you.)</p> <p>We decided not to publish the book with an academic publisher at present because we wanted to make it available to everyone fast and at no cost. The book can be freely downloaded, as well as bought cheaply in <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/univalent-foundations-project/homotopy-type-theory-hardcover/hardcover/product-21076997.html">hardcover</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/univalent-foundations-project/homotopy-type-theory-paperback/paperback/product-21077021.html">paperback</a> versions from <a href="http://lulu.com/">lulu.com</a>. (When was the last time you paid under $30 for a 600 page hardcover academic monograph?) Again, I can feel some people thinking “oh but a real academic publisher bestows quality”. This sort of thinking is reminiscent of Wikipedia vs. Britannica arguments, and we all know how that story ended. Yes, good quality of research must be ensured. But once we accept the fact that anyone can publish anything on the Internet for the whole world to see, and make a cheap professionally looking book out of it, we quickly realize that censure is not effective anymore. Instead we need a decentralized system of endorsments which cannot be manipulated by special interest groups. Things are moving in this direction with the recently established <a href="https://selectedpapers.net/">Selected Papers Network</a> and similar efforts. I hope these will catch on.</p> <p>However, there is something else we can do. It is more radical, but also more useful. Rather than letting people only evaluate papers, why not give them a chance to participate and improve them as well? Put all your papers on github and let others discuss them, open issues, fork them, improve them, and send you corrections. Does it sound crazy? Of course it does, open source also sounded crazy when <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/net.unix-wizards/msg/4dadd63a976019d7?dmode=source&amp;hl=en">Richard Stallman announced</a> his manifesto. Let us be honest, who is going to steal your LaTeX source code? There are much more valuable things to be stolen. If you are tenured professor you can afford to lead the way. Have your grad student teach you git and put your stuff somewhere publicly. Do not be afraid, they tenured you to do such things.</p> <p>So we are inviting everyone to help us improve the book by participating on github. You can leave comments, point out errors, or even better, make corrections yourself! We are not going to worry who you are, how much you are contributing, and who shall take credit. The only thing that matters is whether your contributions are any good.</p> <p>My last observation is about formalization of mathematics. Mathematicians like to imagine that their papers could in principle be formalized in set theory. This gives them a feeling of security, not unlike the one experienced by a devout man entering a venerable cathedral. It is a form of faith professed by logicians. Homotopy Type Theory is an alternative foundation to set theory. We too claim that ordinary mathematics can in principle be formalized in homotopy type theory. But guess what, you do not have to take our word for it! We have formalized the hardest parts of the HoTT book and verified the proofs with computer proof assistants. Not <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT">once</a> but <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda">twice</a>. And we formalized <em>first</em>, then we wrote the book because it was easier to formalize. We win on all counts (if there is a race).</p> <p>I hope you like the book, it contains an amazing amount of new mathematics.</p><a onclick="switchContent('post8','post7')" class="btn" href="#7069e8d84401cf4d60134f65a00da609">Hide</a></div></span>
